Hello, hacks and hackers! Coronavirus has reached the journalism world, and hacks and hackers around the world are getting ready. Splice, SXSW and the International Journalism Festival [have been canceled](https://t.co/ZepwuWgVBC?amp=1).

The events listed in this newsletter will be updated with any changes. Read below for tips and techniques for covering your community.

**Worth a read:**

* The International Fact-Checking Network is compiling fact-checks on the coronavirus. You can [subscribe to the reports](poy.nu/2019CoronaVirusFacts) from all kinds of languages around the world on their Twitter list (ICFN)
* Coronavirus-related products are "spreading quickly," as Nieman Lab put it, and there are now [many web apps, podcasts, newsletters](https://www.niemanlab.org/2020/03/not-to-alarm-you-but-coronavirus-focused-news-products-are-spreading-very-quickly/) and other news products to learn from (Nieman Lab)
* Twitter, a very popular social media network for journalists and journalism, is [debuting its own version](https://techcrunch.com/2020/03/04/twitter-starts-testing-its-own-version-of-stories-called-fleets-which-disappear-after-24-hours/) of "stories" found on Snapchat and Instagram (TechCrunch)
