Hello again, hacks and hackers! Many of our upcoming events, including some local Hacks/Hackers meetups, have been canceled. Poynter is keeping [an updated list](https://www.poynter.org/business-work/2020/is-it-canceled-here-are-the-journalism-and-media-conferences-that-arent-happening-because-of-the-coronavirus/), and we have updated the events in our newsletter below.

Luckily, technology and journalism are two fields that adapt well to staying home. This is a good time to brush up on tips for remote work, remote learning and even remote conferences.
