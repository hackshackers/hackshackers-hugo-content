When a door closes, hacks and hackers, another one opens! Recently ONA [announced](https://journalists.org/2020/05/21/ona20-is-here-there-and-everywhere/) its 2020 conference will be happening online. Not only that, but the event has been spread out over the first two weeks of October, so you can attend while balancing other needs in your life.

The [AI for Good Summit](https://aiforgood.itu.int) followed a similar principle. Instead of attending the summit in Switzerland, you can register for [an ongoing series](https://aiforgood.itu.int/programme-2020/) of talks and interactive discussions.

And if you're a Russian speaker, [School of Data Kyrgyzstan](https://opendata.kg/en/) is hosting an [online data journalism conference](https://lampa2020.tilda.ws) later this week.

**Updated events:**

* [JournoCon](https://journocode.com/journocon/) has been canceled
