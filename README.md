## Front matter style

In static site generators like Hugo, "front matter" refers to a technique of placing metadata (e.g. title, publish date, etc) before the content of a page.

Hugo supports multiple [front matter formats](https://gohugo.io/content/front-matter/). We prefer **YAML** because it's handled automatically in [GitHub previews](https://github.com/blog/1647-viewing-yaml-metadata-in-your-documents). Here's [more info](https://gohugo.io/content/front-matter/#yaml-example).
