Greetings, hacks and hackers! It’s just one week til [Connect Austin][1], and in the meantime, Miami is staging a mediathon, Karachi is learning Instagram, and London is nabbing data guru Simon Rogers for its monthly meetup.

We’re still looking for input on the new Hacks/Hackers website, so please pass [the RFI][2] along to any coders, designers or other Internet makers you may know. We’re still accepting proposals through April 11.

**The week ahead:**

  * The Pakistan chapter is [teaching journalists][3] to use Instagram in Karachi
  * [Miami][4] and [IRE][5] are holding their regular weekly open labs
  * Paris is discussing [producing new media elements][6] like Snapchat and video 360
  * London is featuring a few [all-star speakers][7], including Simon Rogers, Google’s data editor
  * Miami is partnering with Chicas Poderosas to hold a [“mediathon”][8]
  * Austin is holding its first [Connect event][9], featuring Ash Maurya the creator of the Lean Canvas and author of _Running Lean,_ as well as session leaders from the Daily Dot, IBM Watson, Vox Media, and The Texas Tribune.

We’re excited to bring the [Connect series][10] to Austin next week, just in time for the [International Symposium on Online Journalism][11]. Spots are still open, so [register][1] before invites run out! And, as always, follow along at [#HHConnect][12].

**Chapter spotlight:**

Miami kicked off its own [Media Party][13] last weekend, featuring media representatives from Argentina, Brazil, Cuba, Mexico and Venezuela and the U.S.

Co-organizer Mariana Santos said H/H Miami is still experimenting with the event, which was inspired by the wildly successful [HHBA Media Party][14] in Buenos Aires.

> “With over 5,000 members, the Hacks/Hackers group in Buenos Aires is much older and more established, and we can’t just transplant the same event from Argentina to Miami without doing more work to inform the community first. We will put more work into promoting the opportunities so people know what they can expect from an event like this.
>
> After the event, we talked about how to reach more people in Miami for next year’s event. We concluded that breaking up the event into smaller events throughout the year would give us more promotion of the event.”
