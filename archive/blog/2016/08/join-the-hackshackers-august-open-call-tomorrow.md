Welcome, hacks and hackers. We&#8217;ve already reached the end of July, a month that saw more than three dozen Hacks/Hackers meetups across the world. That&#8217;s more than one per day!

A new month also means a new [global open call][1]. Join us tomorrow at [1500 GMT][2]!

**Week ahead:**

  * [Miami][3] is holding its regular OpenHack Miami
  * [IRE][4] in Missouri is holding its weekly meeting
  * Hacks/Hackers is holding its [global open call][1]

**Chapter spotlight:**

[Uruguay][5] hosted a panel last week [to discuss][6] making data projects that are both engaging and reusable. The group relaunched earlier this summer by holding their third annual [DataCampUY][7]. Organizer [Manuel Podetti][8], who helped reboot the chapter, suggested chapters try to hold regular events to keep the group active, perhaps leaning on other groups to help with planning.

> &#8220;When you are planning a event, it&#8217;s good to organize it with other organizations. This allows you to add new people to H / H and learn from other communities.&#8221;
