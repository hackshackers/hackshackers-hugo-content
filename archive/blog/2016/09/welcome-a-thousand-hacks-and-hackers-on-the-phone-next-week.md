**Chapter spotlight:**

[Hong Kong][5] held a [show-and-tell][6] with media leaders earlier this week, and sadly it was the city&#8217;s last meetup for a while. Organizer [Cedric Sam][7] is moving on to New York, and is still looking for someone to pass the torch.

> &#8220;Hong Kong has many news hacker jobs in both local and foreign media, and is often on par with New York and London as regional hub for international media,&#8221; Sam said. &#8220;So I don&#8217;t see why the pool wouldn&#8217;t be large enough to accommodate a vibrant Hacks/Hackers community!&#8221;

If you&#8217;re interested in helping to organize [Hacks/Hackers Hong Kong][5], or know someone who is, [get in touch][7]!
