The Online Journalism Association held its [yearly conference][1] this weekend in Denver, Colorado, and Hacks/Hackers was there to celebrate. [Abigail Edge][2] has managed to drum up significant interest &#8211; including sponsors! &#8211; for the relatively new [Colorado chapter][3] by holding happy hours during national events like [NICAR][4].

**The week ahead:**

  * London is discussing &#8220;interactive imagery&#8221; for its [September meetup][5]
  * Birmingham is hosting a series of [lightning talks][6]
  * [Miami][7] is holding its regular OpenHack Miami
  * [IRE][8] in Missouri is holding its weekly meeting

**Chapter spotlight:**

We&#8217;ve spot-lit [London][9] before, because they churn out [mini-conferences][10] in the time it takes a lot of meetup groups plan a happy hour. In the last year or so, they&#8217;ve started transitioning away from Meetup to Eventbrite, to better handle their more than 4,000 members and 200 monthly attendees.

> &#8220;We’re also overhauling our monthly meetups – changing our focus from growing the number of attendees to securing higher-quality speakers on interesting and controversial topics,&#8221; [Joanna Geary][11] wrote. &#8220;We are also doing extensive work to change how we organise and communicate between ourselves and with our community.&#8221;

London is featuring an &#8220;interactive imagery specialist&#8221; for its [September meetup][5] this week. You can follow their exploits at [#HHldn][12].
