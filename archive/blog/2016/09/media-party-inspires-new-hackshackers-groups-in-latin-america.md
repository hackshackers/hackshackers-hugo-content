**Chapter spotlight:**

[Birmingham][11], in the UK, held an [R meetup][12] last week, inviting people to come learn new skills or get a refresher on the R programming language. [Maria Crosas][13], who put it together, said this was the first event she&#8217;d organized.

> &#8220;Looking for a place that had free Wifi, a projector, and a function room at a pub in a week was not easy.&#8221;

Next week, Birmingham is already off and running to its second rebooted event, a series of [lightning talks][14] on bots, Tableau, text mining with R and scraping with Python.
