Greetings, hacks and hackers. In case you haven&#8217;t noticed, summer might as well be called conference season. Last week, [Connect][1] and [Dataharvest][2] brought journalists together in Brussels. Next up for North America, [IRE][3] comes to New Orleans, [SRC CON][4] to Portland and [Connect Toronto][5]. Let&#8217;s take a look at what individual chapters have been up to.

**The week ahead:**

  * [Miami][6] and [IRE][7] are holding their regular weekly open labs
  * Warsaw is holding its [third meetup][8]
  * Austin will [discuss UX design][9] at the Texas Tribune
  * Venice is discussing how [visual journalism][10] influences social change
  * New Orleans is hosting a [meet-and-greet][11] at the IRE conference

**Chapter spotlight:**

Organizers said the event helped to revitalize the Brussels chapter, and [Camille Pollie][14] said she and others in Brussels will be organizing regular events for the Brussels chapter from here on.

> &#8220;What I’ve learned is that it’s better to inspire people (in) the Hacks/Hackers community via regular events rather than organising a one-off event. We noticed that there is a big need for a more active Brussels Hacks/Hackers community. So after our event we’ve decided to resurrect the Hacks/Hackers community in Brussels and we’re trying to plan our first event.&#8221;
