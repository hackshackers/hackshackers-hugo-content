Next Tuesday, we&#8217;ll be catching up in our global call at 11 a.m. EST (1500 UTC), so [please join us][2]!

**The week ahead:**

  * [Miami][3] is holding OpenHack Miami
  * [IRE][4] in mid-Missouri is holding its regular open lab
  * Hacks/Hackers is holding its [monthly global call][2]

**Chapter spotlight:**

[Zurich, Switzerland][5], met this week to explore [different ways to use social media][6] for reporting, research and engagement. Organizer [Christan Stettler][7] said it was a benefit to the 3-year-old group to hold every meetup in the Neue ZÃ¼rcher Zeitung media office.

> &#8220;This gave the group a structure where and when to meet, even if it&#8217;s the same venue every time. We do have regular attendees which show up every two to four months. And it&#8217;s also a social event where people stay for a drink, having a chat and do connect.&#8221;
