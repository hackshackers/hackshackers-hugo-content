Happy July, hacks and hackers. Meetups tripled from last week to this, with chapters building robots, making maps and hacking hackathons from Portland to Patagonia. Los Angeles also rebooted last week, with the first of a two-parter workshop on Javascript and D3. Let&#8217;s check out their meetup and others coming up this week.

**The week ahead:**

  * Atlanta, Georgia, is [introducing IoT][1]
  * Buenos Aires is [planning the upcoming Media Party][2]
  * Munich is delving into [robot journalism][3]
  * Colorado is going to the Google Boulder office for a [mapping workshop][4]
  * Portland is [discussing community][5] and comments
  * Rosario, Argentina, is holding a [hackathon][6]
  * [Miami][7] and [IRE][8] are holding their regular weekly open labs

**Chapter spotlight:**

[Los Angeles][9] partnered with Codesmith last week for a [workshop on JavaScript][10]. In September, they&#8217;ll follow up with a second session on D3.js. Organizer [David Caswell][11] said Codesmith was interested in teaching the events because they get to demonstrate their coding tutorials to journalists.

> &#8220;This is an ideal partnership,&#8221; Caswell said. &#8220;Coding academies like Codesmith can take non-technical journalists to a remarkable level of technical ability in a very short time, with a hands-on practical teaching style that meshes very well with how journalists tend to work.
