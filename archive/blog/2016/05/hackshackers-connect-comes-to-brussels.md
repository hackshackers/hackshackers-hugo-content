Happy Friday, hacks and hackers! We&#8217;re excited to bring the [Connect series][1] to Brussels in just two weeks. [Connect Brussels][2] is a pan-European event with participants attending from across the EU. Like all Connect events the focus is on building a vibrant media entrepreneurship community &#8212; only a few spots remain, so [register today][3] and spread the word to your colleagues in the region.

  * Johannesburg is holding the second part of its [**#HacktheConstitution event**][11]

**Chapter spotlight:**

South Africa&#8217;s constitution turned 20 years old last week, and [Hacks/Hackers Johannesburg][12] celebrated by holding a hackathon to make it more understandable and accessible. Next week, they&#8217;ll continue [#HacktheConstitution][13] in conjunction with TEDxJohannesburg and Design Share Party.

[Co-organizer Adam Oxford][14] said the initial meeting was geared toward gauging a level of commitment to this project, before the group hosts a series of several more.

> &#8220;Our meetup was really a starting point for a project &#8211; an app or event that can be used to teach people about the SA constitution &#8211; that we think will be quite big by the time we finish it. Originally we&#8217;d hoped to have some structure in place by the end of the evening, but actually most people wanted to talk around the underlying issue in small groups.
>
> This turned out to be really helpful, as the more people talked, the more committed they became to getting involved. Don&#8217;t be afraid to let people talk.&#8221;
