Co-organizer Simon Elvery, who helped re-launch the chapter earlier this year, said they’ve had most success finding sponsors by engaging with the community, especially through meetups coordinated with other groups.

> ”Essentially it was just through announcement at the first meetup. One of the speakers at the first event asked his employer about sponsoring H/H. We&#8217;ve also attempted to get sponsorship through directly sending a proposal to a local industry group. We&#8217;ve received some level of interest in sponsoring, but no agreement yet.”
