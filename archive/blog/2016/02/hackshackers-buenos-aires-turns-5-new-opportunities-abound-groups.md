Happy Leap Day weekend, hacks and hackers. (Is that a thing?)

The largest Hacks/Hackers group (over 5,000 and counting!) had what looks like an epic pool party last week, and other local groups are putting their members in touch with some pretty great opportunities.

**The week ahead:**

  * Hacks/Hackers IRE is holding its regular lab in Columbia, Missouri
  * Sydney is holding [an informational event][1] about Editors Lab, a sort of hacking pageant from countries across the world
  * Miami is holding its regular [OpenHack][2] night with other hacking and coding groups in town
  * Denmark is rebooting with its [first event of 2016][3], topic to be determined
  * Johannesburg is informing local hacks and hackers about [opportunities with impactAFRICA][4]
  * Halifax is holding [an event][5] on Thursday, details to be announced

**Chapter spotlight:**

Buenos Aires celebrated its 5th birthday last week, with a pool party and some quintessential Argentine barbeque. Mariano Blejman shared some tips on keeping the world’s largest H/H chapter alive and well for five years straight:

  * Keep it fresh! New people, new ideas, new projects always
  * Be useful: Communities grow if they are useful and solve real problems
  * Think of something that&#8217;s coming next
  * Meet always in cool places
  * Make parties: We couldn&#8217;t get stronger if it weren&#8217;t for the [Media Party][6]
  * Return people’s investments with happiness
  * Celebrate your birthday in a swimming pool
