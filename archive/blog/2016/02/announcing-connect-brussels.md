Happy Friday, hacks and hackers. We’ve got some exciting news:

{{< tweet 699873451901779969 >}}

Connect events have been selling out fast, so [subscribe for updates][1] to be the first to know when registration opens. Let’s take a look at what’s happening in the rest of the world.

**The week ahead:**

  * Buenos Aires is celebrating its 5th birthday with a [barbeque and pool party][2]. The rest of us are jealous.
  * Hacks/Hackers IRE is holding their [regular lab][3] in Columbia, Missouri.
  * Brisbane is holding [an event][4] full of algorithms, digital security and tasty nibbles.
  * Miami is celebrating [World Information Architecture Day][5] with a daylong event.

**Chapter spotlight:**

The Halifax chapter just got started a few months ago, but their events are already standing room only:

[Rachel Ward][6], one of the co-organizers, shared a tip on getting started with meetups:

> &#8220;Our goal coming out of the first session is better organizing speakers.  We had four excellent people in the last one and the attendees enjoyed their talks. This next time, we&#8217;ll try to meet with the speakers before the event so everyone&#8217;s comfortable with their distinct presentations and with the lengths of each. It&#8217;s one extra step that should smooth things out. Sometimes speakers felt they overlapped or didn&#8217;t have enough time/too much time. Also, a bigger room with sound won&#8217;t hurt!&#8221;

**Worth a read:**

  * Buzzfeed was in the news a lot this week, with [Nieman Lab][7] highlighting their video strategies, [Fast Company][8] outlining their plan for global expansion and [Poynter][9] profiling their investigative team
  * The Guardian experimented with Periscope and Facebook to cover the Westminster Kennel Club Dog Show ([Nieman Lab][10])
  * Robert Caro, author of the seminal 1970s biography _The Power Broker_, [shared his thoughts][11] on how reporting has changed and how it remains the same (Gothamist)

**Job openings:**

  * ESPN is hiring a [product design developer][12]
  * The NYT is looking for a [front-end developer][13] to join its team making branded content
  * The Canada Globe and Mail has several openings for [senior web developers][14]
  * The Financial Times is hiring a [social media producer][15] in London
  * For any audiophiles out there, Southern California Public Radio is looking for a developer to work [specifically on audio applications][15]
  * Bloomberg is looking for web developers in both [web apps][16] and [web crawling][17]

**Call to action:**

We’ve seen a lot of action and engagement from Hacks/Hackers organizers all over the world. What’s one &#8211; just one &#8211; lesson you’ve learned from organizing? Is it how to attract new members? How to make sure they show up? Share your tip with the rest of us at [#hackshackers][18].
