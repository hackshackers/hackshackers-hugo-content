Welcome to October, hacks and hackers! The [Investigating Asia conference][1] took place in Kathmandu last week, as did digital journalism convenings on practically every other continent.

While we&#8217;re still digesting the tips and tools from those events, investigative journalism conferences in [Africa][2] and the [Middle East][3] have already been announced for the upcoming months.

**The week ahead:**

  * Caracas has its [first event][4] in Venezuela
  * [Miami][5] is holding its regular OpenHack Miami
  * [IRE][6] in Missouri is holding its weekly meeting
  * Philadelphia is attending [Barcamp News Innovation][7]

**Chapter spotlight:**

[Zurich][8] took a peek at Switzerland&#8217;s [brand new open data portal][9], opendata.swiss. Zurich has had success with holding meetups every other month or so, rather than every month. &#8220;It&#8217;s good to know some dates in advance so you can tease the next meetup at the current one,&#8221; organizer [Timo Grossenbacher][10] said.

&#8220;Do less better&#8221; is a tip that other organizers have offered before. Check out the guide [on the Hacks/Hackers website][11].
