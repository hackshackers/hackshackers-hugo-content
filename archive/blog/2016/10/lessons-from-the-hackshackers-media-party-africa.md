It&#8217;s almost election time in the U.S., hacks and hackers! Please join us next Wednesday as reporters catch up after [Media Party Africa][1] and batten down the hatches for the American election. The [global open call][2] will take place at 1500 UTC ([find your local time here][3]).

**The week ahead:**

  * The Hacks/Hackers [global call][2] takes place on Wednesday
  * Helsinki is [meeting][4] to discuss a media innovation contest
  * [Miami][5] is holding its regular OpenHack Miami
  * [IRE][6] in Missouri is holding its weekly meeting

**Chapter spotlight:**

[London][7] held its [October meetup][8] last week, inviting speakers from Bloomber, the Wall Street Journal and the BBC to talk about their latest projects. London has been a steadily moving machine for years when it comes to meetups like this, and organizer [Joanna Geary][9] said one advantage is to have the leadership in tightly organized roles.

> &#8220;To make sure everything we do is ploughed back into the community Hacks/Hackers London is registered as a Community Interest Company, with our organisers (Joanna, Pete, Sarah, Cassie and Jeremy) as named directors.
>
> Whilst this took some upfront paperwork from us, it protects us from personal liability if something goes wrong at an event and, more importantly, provides a structure that means we can move on, but Hacks/Hackers London stays to serve the community.&#8221;

Not every Hacks/Hackers chapter needs or wants a formalized system like this. But the London group also shared their [Roles & Responsibilities template][10] and [task assignment spreadsheet][11], which help them manage an enormous amount of work and responsibility among five organizers.
