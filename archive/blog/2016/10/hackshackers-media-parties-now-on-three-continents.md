This weekend, a third Hacks/Hackers group held its own Media Party, this time in South Africa. The [sold-out event][1] is bringing 350 attendees plus speakers from around the world to Cape Town to discuss African media innovation and civic technology. [Miami][2] held [its second Media Party][3] in April, and of course [Buenos Aires][4] holds the trophy for the original [Media Party][5], which celebrated its fifth anniversary this year in Argentina.

  * [IRE][8] in Missouri is holding its weekly meeting

  * Singapore is holding a special [U.S. election][10] event

**Chapter spotlight:**

Earlier this month, [Montreal][11] met [to talk about][12] cloud-based services for journalists. Speaker and co-organizer [Roberto Rocha][13] said the group has been promoting themselves by finding new members and new venues though other local meetups.

> &#8220;We&#8217;re still figuring out the best way to organize events, if it&#8217;s by delegating tasks, or letting organizers do things their way. We&#8217;re also experimenting with the format: short presentations followed by networking time, or workshops/demos.&#8221;
