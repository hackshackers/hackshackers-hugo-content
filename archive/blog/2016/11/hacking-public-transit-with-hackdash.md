Greetings, hacks and hackers. A lot of the suggested reads this week follow the same trends as last week: cybersecurity and privacy, fake news and press freedom. On the plus side, there&#8217;s a veritable deluge of journalism job postings this week, from San Francisco to Hong Kong to Johannesburg.

**The week ahead:**

  * [Miami][1] is holding its regular OpenHack Miami
  * [IRE][2] in Missouri is holding its weekly meeting

**Chapter spotlight:**

{{< tweet 799627575949541376 >}}

The group [used HackDash][5], a tool created by the Hacks/Hackers Buenos Aires team to organize hackthons. It&#8217;s the only tool of its kind and [was designed][6] to fill a need that the HHBA Media Party made clear. The Buenos Aires team makes it clear HackDash is an [open source][7] project and [available for anyone][8] who wants to use it for a hackathon or other event.
