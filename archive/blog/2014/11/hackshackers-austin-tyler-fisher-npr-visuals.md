[Tyler Fisher][1] of [NPR Visuals][2] joined us on Nov. 11 at the Statesman to talk about his team and their election coverage. Tyler is a recent graduate from Northwestern University with a major in Journalism. But Tyler has directed his career toward Web development and news applications.

In his talk, Tyler provided background on his team and the history of their election coverage. He provided a good dose of tech for the developers in the crowd, but handled the &#8220;how&#8221; and &#8220;why&#8221; questions for those who were interested in concepts and strategy. He discussed the strategy around creating a separate [Chromecast device][3] application for elections, as well. His presentation can be found atÂ <http://tylerjfisher.com/elections14-slides>.

Tyler&#8217;s visit and snacks for this meetup were provided by Texas State University as part of the TexasMusicViz project that was funded by the [Challenge Fund for Innovation in Journalism Education][4], funded by Online News Association, Excellence and Ethics in Journalism Foundation, the Robert R. McCormick Foundation, the John S. and James L. Knight Foundation, the Democracy Fund and the Rita Allen Foundation.
