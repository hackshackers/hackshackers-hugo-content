More than 150 hacks and hackers gathered Wednesday at Twitter&#8217;s main headquarters in San Francisco to hear the company&#8217;s Data Editor Simon Rogers talk about data&#8217;s increasingly important role in journalism and how Twitter makes sense of the hundreds of millions of tweets passing through its platform every day.

From mapping the patterns of disadvantage that contributed to the UK riots, to data visualizations of Oscars tweets, Rogers helped demystify the collection strategies and tools required for top-class data analysis and visualization.

His colleague, data visualization scientist Krist Wongsuphasawat followed with more explanation of the data science behind beautiful dataviz, including an animation of the world&#8217;s reaction to goals in the World Cup this year.
