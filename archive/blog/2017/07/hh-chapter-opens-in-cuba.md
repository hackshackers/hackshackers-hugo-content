Hi, hacks and hackers. Let's give a friendly welcome to [Hacks/Hackers Havana](https://www.meetup.com/Periodistas-y-programadores-Habana/) (a.k.a. Periodistas y programadores de Habana), which just opened up shop in Cuba. Organizer and founder Barbara Maseda said they had higher than expected attendance for their first event.
