Evening, hacks and hackers. A slew of innovation [grants](https://www.lenfestinstitute.org/grants/) and [residency](https://www.lenfestinstitute.org/residencies/) programs, headed by one of Hacks/Hackers's original founders, [Burt Herman](https://twitter.com/burtherman), have been announced by the US-based Lenfest Institute. Priority is given to Philadelphia-area projects, but it's applicants can work from anywhere.

**Worth a read:**

* The push for journalistic transparency calls for sharing source documents with the public, but that can be tough if the docs where leaked to you by a confidential source.

* The Knight Center [released an ebook](https://knightcenter.utexas.edu/blog/00-18383-knight-center%E2%80%99s-e-book-%E2%80%9Cinnovative-journalism-latin-america%E2%80%9D-now-also-available-englis) called Innovative Journalism in Latin America, available in English and Portuguese (Knight Center)
* [Another report](https://www.cjr.org/tow_center/a-new-model-for-high-impact-investigative-reporting.php), by the Columbia Journalism Review, examined new models for invstigative reporting, like ICIJ's Panama Papers project (CJR)
