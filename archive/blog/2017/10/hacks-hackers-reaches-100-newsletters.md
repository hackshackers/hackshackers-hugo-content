Happy 100th, hacks and hackers! This newsletter has reached 100 issues, and we look forward to keeping everyone connected in the future.

As a reminder, we also have a [list serv for local organizers](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/hackshackersorganizers) and a [Slack channel](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/hackshackersorganizers) for everybody. You can get an auto-invite to the Slack channel [here](https://hackshackersslackers.herokuapp.com/).

[HackPack](https://hackpack.press), which shares not only a similar name but similar goals and interests, has undertaken [a survey](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSd_JpOBq11q6mCBCQBsmOyjxSUeBLu0xEaiyOtFsY04K22ZQg/viewform) to determine the costs and balances of freelancing in journalism. If you haven't already, check out their [many international job postings](https://hackpack.press/feed/list/?category=subscribed) and [answer their survey](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSd_JpOBq11q6mCBCQBsmOyjxSUeBLu0xEaiyOtFsY04K22ZQg/viewform).
