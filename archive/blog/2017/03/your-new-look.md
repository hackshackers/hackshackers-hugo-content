Welcome to your new [hackshackers.com](hackshackers.com)! The new site makes a lot of changes that community members have long been asking for, and is the result of months of collaborative work with Hacks/Hackers organizers and members from around the world. Weâ€™ve also got an updated logo that cleverly modernizes our visual identity.

The site now includes:

* A resources page for organizers
* A directory of local groups
* A space for blog posts and community news
* A taxonomy system for finding local groups and topics
* An updated about page with our mission and history
* A style guide with the new design and logos

Nearly 100 local groups making up Hacks/Hackers have inspired change and jumpstarted media innovation over the last seven years, but the website has been outdated for a while. When we asked community members what they would like to see in a new site, several responded that they didn't know we had one to begin with.

So back in 2015, the intrepid volunteers of the [Website Action Group](https://github.com/hackshackers/action-group-website) put together a list of needed improvements. These included:

* A [centralized repository](https://github.com/hackshackers/action-group-website/wiki) for Hacks/Hackers information, such as tools for organizers and a directory of local groups.
* Clearer information - a lot of the content on the site was out of date or unorganized.
* Easier and quicker routes to the content users want. This [turned out to be](https://github.com/hackshackers/action-group-website/blob/master/meeting-notes/2015-10-19.md), for example, guides on how to find new members, run a chapter or start a new one.

We got dozens of replies to a [survey back in 2015](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1TwBPhjRVXI1HbgQU9L62MSz02YOPDYWhW8pbzyBllkE/edit#gid=232438511), indicating that more than a few of us were interested in overhauling hackshackers.com. The committee debated ways to take action, including migrating the site to Github, incorporating etherpad or organizing via a Google group.

Things really rolling in earnest when [Alley Interactive](https://www.alleyinteractive.com) offered to take over the redesign as part of their mission to help media companies adapt to the evolving digital landscape.

Over the course of half a year, Alley drilled down to the group's essence: openness, transparency, grassroots organizing, collaboration and experimentation. Designer Christa Field shared her thoughts on incorporating these elements into the new logo and web design. Developer Josh Kadis also provided a detailed account of what's going on under the hood. The short version is, it's a static site generated by [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) and made user-editable by [Github](https://github.com/). 

Special thanks go out to the Alley Interactive team, Josh Kadis, Matt Nadolny, Christa Field and Jaimie Olmstead; the Website Action Group, Phillip Smith, Misha Vinokur, Matt Carroll, Michael Pereira and Thomas Wilburn; the calendar designer, Peter MacRobert; the editors, Burt Herman and Samantha Sunne; and the valued hacks and hackers who offered their input.
