Welcome to a new year, hacks and hackers! 2016 was a tumultuous one for many Hacks/Hackers groups around the world, and 2017 may or may not be more stable. Last week we featured [NiemanLab&#8217;s predictions][1] for the coming year; this week we look back at ProPublica&#8217;s [year in visual storytelling][2].

**Chapter spotlight:**

[Austin][3] held a series of events last year, ranging from [a D3 workshop][4] to a massive [Connect event][5]. Organizer [Cindy Royal][6] said the organizers, who come from two local universities, two local news outlets and one national outlet, take turns organizing events, resulting in four or five events a year.

Distributing work this way maximizes what the group can accomplish while keeping the workload on organizers as light as possible. Check out more [tips from organizers][7] on the Hacks/Hackers website.
