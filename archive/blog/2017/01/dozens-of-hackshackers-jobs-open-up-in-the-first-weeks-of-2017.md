It&#8217;s a new year, hacks and hackers, and newsrooms seem to be ushering in the new: more than two dozen job openings were posted since our last newsletter, ranging from Research Professor to Motion Graphics Editor. The Washington Post alone named eight new openings on its [new rapid-response investigations team][1].

**Chapter spotlight:**

[San Francisco][2] &#8211; the original Hacks/Hackers chapter &#8211; has held nearly five dozen events since 2009, when it was first founded. This year they&#8217;ve collaborated often with other Bay Area interest groups, like the Solutions Journalism Network and the Brown Institute for Media Innovation.

[Ryan Singel][3], one of the current organizers, said he was surprised by how much luck he has had searching for a partner or venue with a good old-fashioned social media call. For a recent event, he said,

> &#8220;I couldn&#8217;t find any room in our usual spots, so tweeted out that we needed a space and what the topic was. That landed us an invite from a local security company called OpenDNS, which also then bought pizza and drinks for the get-together. This won&#8217;t always work, but a tweet is free, so worth a shot.&#8221;
