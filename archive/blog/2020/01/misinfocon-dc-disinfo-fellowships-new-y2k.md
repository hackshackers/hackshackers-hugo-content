Welcome to the new year, hacks and hackers. Last year saw the addition of [Northeast England](https://www.meetup.com/Hacks-Hackers-NE-England/) and [Seoul, South Korea](https://www.meetup.com/Hacks-Hackers-Seoul/). Here's to many more meetups to come!

In case you missed the announcement last week, our joint project [MisinfoCon](https://misinfocon.com/) is holding an upcoming gathering in Washington, D.C. [MisinfoCon @ NASEM](https://misinfocon.com/misinfocon-nasem-is-here-misinfocon-7-0-is-focused-on-health-and-science-misinformation-71baa93d8717) will focus on health and science misinformation, in partnership with the [U.S. National Academies of Sciences](https://www.nationalacademies.org/).

**The week ahead:**
* Montreal is [meeting at the pub](https://www.meetup.com/HacksHackersMontreal/events/266595748/)

**Worth a read:**

* Data privacy has been a hot issue for a long time, with a fringe group even advocating for users to be paid for their data. But how would that work? A team from Berkeley's AI research team [ran an experiment](https://bair.berkeley.edu/blog/2019/12/16/data-worth/?utm_medium=email&utm_source=topic+optin&utm_campaign=awareness&utm_content=20200108+data+nl&mkt_tok=eyJpIjoiWkROa01qUmhOalE0TmpNMSIsInQiOiIzR3dWaDdXWVhtT3pqaWlNdjRBdnJTOU5mY3J1b2pPR0NkSVwvZ0c4R1JFeFhrRWNocE5PM2JDdmRzOVROZjBucTNHR2NyODIxM21aS1dacjh3Y2FkaENacElndFZmVTlYODFJTktLMjBvYStcLzBXbFpicWF3REZySjYrNGZWNnlVIn0%3D) (BAIR)
* Facebook made some waves last week when it said it would [ban deep fakes](https://www.niemanlab.org/2020/01/facebook-bans-deepfakes-but-lots-of-other-manipulated-videos-are-still-allowed/) from the platform. Shortly afterward, [Reddit followed suit](https://www.digitaltrends.com/news/reddit-bans-impersonation-content-including-deepfakes/). (Nieman Lab)
* Twenty years after the turn of the millennium, the Y2K bug is still [coming back to haunt us](https://www.newscientist.com/article/2229238-a-lazy-fix-20-years-ago-means-the-y2k-bug-is-taking-down-computers-now/), thanks to some lazy code from two decades ago (New Scientist)
