The Google News Initiative (GNI) created a [Global Journalism Emergency Relief Fund](https://blog.google/outreach-initiatives/google-news-initiative/global-journalism-emergency-relief-fund-local-news) to financially assist local news organizations that are struggling to stay afloat while covering COVID-19 in their communities.
