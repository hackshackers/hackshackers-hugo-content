Hello, hacks and hackers! We hope everyone is staying safe. Some local Hacks/Hackers groups have started holding meetups online. If you're thinking about doing the same, keep these tips in mind:

* **Get a paid account for more security.** Marcela Kunova, who organized the [recent virtual meetup for H/H Brighton](https://www.meetup.com/Hacks-Hackers-Brighton/events/269181291/), said free accounts can leave you too vulnerable to hackers and "Zoom bombers."
* **Poll your community to see which platform to use.** Christine Gicheru, who ran the recent [meetup online for H/H Lagos](https://www.facebook.com/events/206692343752584/), said Google Hangouts worked the best for their audience.
* **Don't share the URL publicly.** Connie Moon Sehat, who manages [virtual meetings for the Credibility Coalition](https://credibilitycoalition.org), suggested [giving attendees a link or access code](https://billdutton.me/2020/03/26/zoom-bombing-the-future-of-education/) via email.

If you need the software to do it, Hacks/Hackers has a paid Zoom account we may be able to make available. If you are a group organizer, please [get in touch](mailto:samantha@hackshackers.com).
