Howdy, hacks and hackers! This week, we found more remote jobs than jobs in person. Work anywhere around the world at cool places like GIJN, the Washington Post and High Country News.

{{< tweet 1255195837287804931 >}} 

And don't forget, anyone is welcome to join our [global call](https://hackshackers.com/resources/global-open-call/) next Wednesday. We'll be discussing the [MisinfoCon](https://hackshackers.com/resources/misinfocon/) Slack channel and upcoming changes to Meetup groups.

**Worth a read:**

* DataJournalism.com partnered with Craig Newmark Philanthropies to publish their first [Verification Handbook](https://datajournalism.com/read/handbook/verification-3). BuzzFeed News' Craig Silverman put together this thorough list of verification tools and resources.
* COVID-19 has threatened nonprofit revenue and decimated in-person events. The [Membership Puzzle Project asked](https://membershippuzzle.org/articles-overview/membership-during-coronavirus) how 15 member-funded news organizations have adapted.
* Splice, whose media conference in Thailand was canceled, is building [an online community](https://splicelowres.com). They [have some tips](https://www.splicemedia.com/how-we-did-splice-low-res/) for building your own.
