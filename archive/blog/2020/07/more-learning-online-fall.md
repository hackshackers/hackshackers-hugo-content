Welcome to July, hacks and hackers! More conferences have, unsurprisingly, moved to online. Many organizations are experimenting with a long series of workshops rather than a packed few days where sessions overlap.

See the events list below for the most up to date information.

**Worth a read:**

* The National Institute of Health in the U.S. [launched a secure national database](https://ncats.nih.gov/news/releases/2020/NIH-launches-analytics-platform-to-harness-nationwide-COVID-19-patient-data-to-speed-treatments) for doctors, scientists and researchers to study demographics of COVID-19 patients in hopes of better understanding the disease
* Lokal is [a mobile news app in India](https://www.niemanlab.org/2020/06/to-crack-indias-diverse-and-massive-local-news-markets-lokal-started-asking-users-what-they-actually-wanted/) that jumped from 1,600 users to millions in less than two years. The founders attribute their growth partly to asking their audience how they consume news, and implementing their feedback.
