Greetings from Buenos Aires!

I&#8217;ve spent the last few days at the [Media Party][1] that Hacks/Hackers Buenos Aires has put on for the fourth year in a row, bringing hundreds of people to be inspired, collaborate and hack together. It&#8217;s an amazing event that shows the potential of what we can do if we work together on a broader level.

With Hacks/Hackers organizers from around the world present, we held a workshop to talk about how we as the global Hacks/Hackers movement can collaborate more across geographic boundaries. One clear thing that came out from the discussion was a need for more transparency at all levels of the organization. That led to a proposal for a regular conference call for Hacks/Hackers organizers and members to share what’s we’re all doing and talk about where we are going.

We’re planning to do these calls on the **FIRST TUESDAY OF EVERY MONTH**. I know it’s short notice, but we’re going ahead with the first call **THIS TUESDAY, SEPT. 1 at 1500 GMT** — which is:

0800 in San Francisco

1100 in New York

1200 in Buenos Aires

1700 in Johannesburg

2030 in New Delhi

2300 in Hong Kong

(It’s not easy to find a time that works across the world, but for now this is the best option.)

I’ll be sharing more details on the call-in number and agenda ahead of the call.

We look forward to hearing from you Tuesday and on future calls.
