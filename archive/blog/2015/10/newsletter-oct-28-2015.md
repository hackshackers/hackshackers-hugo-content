Happy Wednesday. Starting next week, we’ll include job postings as a section of this newsletter. If you’re hiring for a position that’d be of interest to Hacks/Hackers members, send it our way.

****The week ahead for Hacks/Hackers:****

  * In ****Montréal**** tonight, they’ll be learning about [Crypto 101][1] &#8211; Secure communication for journalists &#8211; including understanding encryption and tools to use for protection from government surveillance.
  * In ****Zürich****, the chapter will hear [how Neue Zürcher Zeitung built][2] [this beautiful 3-D interactive][3] about the first ascent of the Matterhorn.
  * Hacks/Hackers Denmark hosts an event in ****Copenhagen****, “[Transforming Journalism Through Interactivity][4]” with speakers from The Wall Street Journal and the Danish Broadcasting Corporation.
  * The ****Hong Kong**** chapter [meets up at Google’s offices][5] to hear from Isao Matsunami, James Griffiths (CNN) and Pili Hu (Initium Media).
  * The new ****Islamabad**** chapter of Hacks/Hackers Pakistan [holds its very first meeting][6]. (Always great to see new chapters launching.)
  * In ****Amsterdam****, the chapter is holding a “[Refugee Hackathon][7].” It aims to bring journalists, technologist and organizations together to chat about existing and potential future projects and collaborations. From the event page: “We hope this meetup will be the first in a series of meetups on this topic, where we can come together to build a better situation for what is currently a crisis.”

**Bay Area** Hacks/Hackers [met up at Stanford][8] on Tuesday to hear from folks from CIR, Vocativ and SmartNews. Gerald Rich talked about GIS and online mapping tools for data visualizations (notes are here: [bit.ly/hhstanford-maps][9]), Naoki Orii from SmartNews discussed the difference between exploration and exploitation in algorithmic recommendations, and Allison McCartney explained her work on the interface for Reveal’s [The Lost and Found][10] project to crowdsource connecting missing persons and unidentified bodies in cold cases. For tweets and photos from the event, [here’s a Storify][11].

****Worth a read:****

  * [Five things we learnt from October’s Hacks/Hackers London][12] (Peter Yeung, Interhacktives)

  * [How two local newsrooms are using photo archives to connect with readers][16] (CJR)

****Call to action:****

Thanks to those of you who [shared your thoughts][17] on how to improve hackshackers.com last week.

This week, another survey for you: Pete MacRobert of Hacks/Hackers London would love to ****hear about your experience using Meetup**** (or not) for Hacks/Hackers events, as he and others think about an open-source alternative platform for communities like ours: <http://bit.ly/meetupquestionnaire>

And if you missed it a couple weeks ago, we’re [still looking for feedback][18] about how this newsletter works for you and how it can be improved.

That’s all for now. See you next Wednesday.

Produced by Julia Haslanger. Say hi: @JuliaJRH.
