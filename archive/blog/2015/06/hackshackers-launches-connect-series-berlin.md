We kicked off Hacks/Hackers&apos; [first-ever global event series][3] with a packed room of more than 100 participants at the Berlin Factory, bringing together members of the grassroots movement along with entrepreneurs, journalists and developers passionate about the intersection of media and technology.Intense media hacking @HacksHackers @burtherman @NMA_vc #hhcxn http://t.co/oB1x4LlLv8Meinolf EllersThe event took place steps away from the former Berlin Wall in the once-divided city, an especially fitting location because Hacks/Hackers is all about tearing down walls between journalism and technology. Through building respect between storytellers and developers, we aim to create a sustainable future for journalism to continue its essential watchdog role for society, whatever form that may take.We are live in Berlin with the first Connect event kicking off by @phillipadsmith #hhcxn http://t.co/ZUMItel5b1Hacks/HackersOver one and a half days, attendees at the event had the chance to collaborate, network and discuss the opportunities and challenges facing media.All of these diverse people want to redesign news. Good times for journalism! #hhcxn http://t.co/ZLzdlNogkTJens TwiehausThe centerpiece of the event was a design-thinking experience giving everyone a chance to meaningfully connect with each other, hopefully finding potential collaborators for future projects.Burt HermanOff to a buzzing start at Factory Berlin #designthinking #innovation #hhcxn #hackshackers #googlenewslabAshley MHacks/Hackers ist nicht einfach nur reden, hier wird heute geschafft! #HHCXNKersten A.
