A few weeks ago, we launched an exciting initiative (in partnership with Google) to support media entrepreneurship, an [event series we call Connect][1]. As part of the launch, we decided to replace the main Hacks/Hackers site with an information and signup page for Connect. 

At the time, that seemed to make sense. The old site was years out of date, filled with months-old content and daily traffic had fallen to the single-digits. It seemed logical to put the newest thing front-and-center while we figured out how to revamp the old site.

In retrospect, that wasn’t a good decision. We heard from a number of people in the community who expressed concern about the switch, wondering what happened to the old site. The site badly needs an overhaul and replacing the homepage was meant as a transitional step on the way to doing that. We should have made that more clear.

So today, we’re doing what we should have done in the first place and moving the Connect site to its [own subdomain at http://connect.hackshackers.com][1], and restoring the old Hacks/Hackers site to the main domain.

We’d welcome any feedback and thoughts on how to make a new website that embodies the vibrancy of the Hacks/Hackers community. Email us at site [at] hackshackers.com
