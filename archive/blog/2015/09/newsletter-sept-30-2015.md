Last week Hacks/Hackers chapters around the world tackled a ton of great topics: developer newsroom culture, chat apps, experimental video approaches, interactive news web apps in Angular and so much more.

On a personal note, it was wonderful to meet some Hacks/Hackers organizers at the Online News Association conference in Los Angeles last week. I hope to find more chances to meet Hacks/Hackers organizers and members face-to-face. Y&#8217;all are a good group of folks.

This next week is shaping up to be another great one for Hacks/Hackers, so let’s dive in:

**The week ahead for Hacks/Hackers:**

  * The **Portland, Ore.**, chapter meets with two members of [The Coral Project][1] team to discuss &#8220;[Rethinking the Conversation][2]&#8221; around online commenting. 
  * In **Columbia, Mo.**, Hacks/Hackers-IRE will be talking about [web-scraping in Python][3]. 
  * Hacks/Hackers **Nairobi** meets to discuss [net neutrality and its importance in the emerging and developing world][4]. 
  * Four college instructors in **New York City** will talk about what it&#8217;s like to [teach data + journalism][5]while also working as a journalist. 
  * In **Berlin**, the Hacks/Hackers crowd will meet at [Zeit Online&#8217;s newsroom][6] to hear from [Tran Ha][7],[Anh Hoà Truong][8] and [Martin Kotynek][9] about the work each of them did while at Stanford. 

**Chapter spotlight:** **Hacks/Hackers London**

On Thursday, a sold-out crowd of hacks and hackers gathered at Twitter&#8217;s UK offices. [Read the tweets from the event][10] to learn more about timesXtwo (a video collaboration from BBC and ABC), see how attendees played around with Firechat (a chat tool that has proven useful in protest situations &#8211; or when you want a backchannel to chatter in during a Hacks/Hackers event), and several intriguing lightning pitches. Another option: [Check out these live notes][11] taken by Sarah Marshall.

**Worth a read:**

  * [Slate is taking steps to reduce its page load time by 75 percent][12] (Joseph Lichterman at Nieman Lab) 
  * [New York Times editor: Data journalism starts with people][13] (Downtown Devil, Phoenix)

  * [The AP will build out data partnerships with local newsrooms with $400,000 from Knight][15] (Nieman Lab) 
  * [What I Learned Meeting Innovators in East Coast Media][16] ([Cindy Royal][17], co-founder of Hacks/Hackers Austin, for MediaShift) 
  * [Spotify but for the Titanic: A Proposal for the Future of News and Publishing][18] ([Zeynep Tufekci][19]) 
  * [The Worcester Sun wants to bootstrap paywalled hyperlocal digital into a Sunday print product][20](Dan Kennedy for Nieman Lab) 
  * [With its curation product Twitter becomes an editorial beast. Does this beast have a soul?][21] (Jay Rosen) 
  * [Remember Your Old Graphing Calculator? It Still Costs a Fortune — Here&#8217;s Why][22] (Jack Smith IV at Mic) 

**Call to action:**

**What was your very first experience with Hacks/Hackers?** Write up your memory (recent memory or not-so-recent, depending on how long you&#8217;ve participated in Hacks/Hackers) or dig up a photo and send it to me, or tweet it at @HacksHackers. I&#8217;ll collect some of the responses and include them in next week&#8217;s newsletter.

That&#8217;s all for now. See you next week!
