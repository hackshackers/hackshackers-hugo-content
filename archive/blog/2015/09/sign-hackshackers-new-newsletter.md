We&#8217;re launching a new newsletter as a way for you to learn from and about what&#8217;s going on in the more than 70(!) Hacks/Hackers chapters around the world. Each newsletter will include a list of upcoming events, a section spotlighting an interesting chapter or member, a few linksÂ about industry news or other popular topics, and a suggested call to action if you want to get more involved.
