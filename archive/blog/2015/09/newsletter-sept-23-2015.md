**Welcome to the new Hacks/Hackers weekly newsletter.** This newsletter aims to be a service to you &#8211; a way for you to learn from and about what&#8217;s going on in the 75(!) Hacks/Hackers chapters around the world. The newsletter has four parts (for now &#8211; &#8217;til you suggest others):

  * &#8220;**Chapter spotlight**&#8221; gives you a quick window into the life of one chapter. If you&#8217;d like to nominate a chapter (or an exceptional organizer), let me ([Julia Haslanger][1], the author of this newsletter) know.
  * &#8220;**The week ahead for Hacks/Hackers**&#8221; is simply a list of Meetup events by the chapters and occasionally events that may be of interest to the larger network.
  * &#8220;**Worth a read**&#8221; curates whatever is popular and/or of interest to the larger Hacks/Hackers network. To determine popularity, I&#8217;m using [Vellum][2] (from NYTLabs) and two Twitter lists &#8211; the [Hacks/Hackers chapters][3] and &#8220;[the hacks and hackers][4]&#8220;. If you notice yourself or your chapter missing from the lists, holler at [@HacksHackers][5] on Twitter.
  * &#8220;**Call to action**&#8221; is your chance to get involved and help out. Each week, the call could be something as small as inviting one new person to a Hacks/Hackers event, or as big as joining a committee.

So, without further ado, here&#8217;s this week&#8217;s Hacks/Hackers newsletter:

**Chapter spotlight: ****Hacks/Hackers Sydney (Australia)**

The Sydney chapter just relaunched after being dormant since mid-2013. The chapter held an event on &#8220;[Data Journalism and Investigations in Political Reporting][6],&#8221; which brought out a crowd. [Check out the great tweets from the event.][7]

_Know a chapter or organizer up to something special that we should spotlight? [Let me know][8]._

**The week ahead for Hacks/Hackers:**

  * The **Seattle** chapter meets for a [networking happy hour][9] &#8230; at Starbucks, of course.
  * In **Los Angeles**, the [Online News Association conference][10] gets underway, with a good showing of organizers and members from Hacks/Hackers chapters &#8211; including [Burt][11] and me, so say hi if you&#8217;re there, too.
  * In **São Paulo**, they&#8217;re learning about [developer culture in the GloboEsporte newsroom][12].
  * The **Uruguay** Hacks/Hackers chapter is joining forces with a few other groups to work on[building an interactive timeline of government officials][13], like [Cargografias][14] in Argentina.
  * In **London**, the [monthly meetup][15] will happen at Twitter UK&#8217;s offices and they&#8217;ll hear from India Rakusen, a reporter covering the refugee crisis for timesXtwo, a new BBC/ABC collaboration.
  * In **Birmingham** (UK), the crew will hear from three speakers on [interactivity and investigations][16].

**Worth a read:**

  * [Facebook Ramps Up Its Instant Articles, and the Washington Post Is All In][17] (Re/Code)
  * [Protecting Yourself From Digital Snoops Isn’t that Difficult][18] (Hacks/Hackers Africa)
  * [Connecting the Dots of a Global Movement: The &#8220;Why&#8221; and the &#8220;What&#8221; of Hacks/Hackers Connect][19] (Phillip Smith)
  * [‘Foreign media welcome,’ China says. But the harassment continues.][20] (The Washington Post)
  * [A New Universal &#8216;New Yorker&#8217; Cartoon Caption: &#8216;I’d like to add you to my professional network on LinkedIn.&#8217;][21] (The Atlantic)

**Call to action:**
