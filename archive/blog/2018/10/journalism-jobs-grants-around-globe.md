* Niren Tolsi delivered a [fire-themed lecture](http://journalism.co.za/2018-ruth-first-memorial-lecture-delivered-by-niren-tolsi-full-paper/) last week about media in South Africa. As Jason Norwood-Young wrote in [Naked Data](https://nakeddata.co.za/), "It is a burning indictment against modern journalism; a searing take on social media; and sets fire to a few bridges along the way … It is enlightening, and important, and very, very good." (Jocoza)
* A Reuters Institute study found that poorer people in the UK [consume less news than wealthier people](http://www.niemanlab.org/2018/10/if-youre-poor-in-the-uk-you-get-less-worse-news-especially-online-new-research-suggests/), especially online (NiemanLab)
