* A [Pew study](http://www.journalism.org/2018/09/10/news-use-across-social-media-platforms-2018/) found that about two-thirds of Americans get their news from social media, even though respondents said it didn't actually improve their understanding of current events (Pew)
* Newsletters offer a more colloquial way to share your organizationâ€™s content with your audience. The Splice Newsroom compiled a [list of tips](https://gijn.org/2018/09/17/how-to-start-your-own-media-newsletter/?mc_cid=a83f422c02&mc_eid=527b5eb6fb) on how to start a newsletter, with translations in Arabic, English, French, Portuguese, Russian and Spanish (GIJN)
* Poynter compiled a [list of digital tools and resources](https://www.poynter.org/news/12-tools-and-resources-useful-during-hurricanes-and-other-disasters) that help when reporting on hurricanes and other natural disasters, like neighborhood social networks and walkie-talkie-esque phone apps (Poynter)
