The events will hone in on topics like verification, fact-checking, safety and security, data journalism and ethics.

**Happening this week:**

* London is learning about [digital news in China](https://www.eventbrite.co.uk/e/hackshackers-london-september-2018-meetup-tickets-49596379105)
* IRE is holding its [regular open lab](https://www.meetup.com/hackshackersIRE/events/254634618/)

* Berlin is discussing [data breaches](https://www.meetup.com/Hacks-Hackers-Berlin/events/254662209/)

**Worth a read:**

* Google launched a new tool called [Dataset Search](https://toolbox.google.com/datasetsearch), which indexes datasets using their metadata. [The tool, which is still in beta,](https://www.theverge.com/2018/9/5/17822562/google-dataset-search-service-scholar-scientific-journal-open-data-access) includes academic, government and news sources (The Verge)
* Student journalists face unique challenges, like balancing classwork and addressing pushback from school administrations. [The Lead](https://medium.com/@blatchfordtaylor/welcome-to-the-lead-a-newsletter-for-student-journalists-4da755fad8c9) is a newsletter starting this week that aims to provide resources and advice for student journalists while highlighting their work. (Medium)
* Facebook’s algorithm for distinguishing between political propaganda and journalism about politics has been inaccurate, identifying content from organizations like Reveal, ProPublica and Orb Media as political. [NiemanLab looks](http://www.niemanlab.org/2018/09/are-you-sure-that-promoted-article-is-still-political-content-facebook/) at how this is affecting organizations’ social media presence and what Facebook is doing to finetune its filters.
