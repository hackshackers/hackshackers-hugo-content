Hello, hacks and hackers! John Wihbey, a journalism professor at Northeastern University, surveyed journalists for his new book [The Social Fact: News and Knowledge in a Networked World](https://mitpress.mit.edu/books/social-fact), where he explores how "the structure of news, information, and knowledge and their flow through society are changing."

In [this write-up in NiemanLab](https://www.niemanlab.org/2019/05/journalists-know-they-need-to-get-better-with-data-and-statistics-but-they-have-a-long-way-to-go/), he found that most journalists thought it was "very important" to be able to interpret statistics from sources and research studies. Unfortunately, most also reported that they were not very well equipped to do so.
