Hello again, hacks and hackers! 2019 is slowly coming to a close, but it's not too late to catch a media or tech event - that is, if you're near Munich, Kyiv or Philadelphia.

{{< tweet 1193965844939890688 >}}

[SRCCON:LEAD](https://lead.srccon.org/), a [News Impact Summit](https://medium.com/we-are-the-european-journalism-centre/whats-new-in-climate-politics-and-local-reporting-join-our-free-news-impact-events-and-find-out-3c9bf2a833af) and a [Conference on Investigative Journalism](https://ijnet.org/en/opportunity/conference-investigative-journalism-open-ukraine) are all happening before the holiday break.

Plus, [Hacks/Hackers London](https://www.hackshackersldn.co.uk/) has an epic [upcoming discussion](https://www.eventbrite.co.uk/e/hackshackers-london-november-2019-meetup-tickets-53581034316) on the intersection of journalism and artificial intelligence. You can follow along at [#HHLdn](https://twitter.com/hackshackersldn?lang=en).
