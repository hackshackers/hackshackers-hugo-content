Greetings, hacks and hackers! You may have seen [conversations](https://twitter.com/kimbui/status/1196799386094882816) from [#SRCCONLEAD](https://twitter.com/hashtag/SRCCONLEAD?src=hashtag_click) floating across your timeline, as there were a lot of media leaders there, and they had a lot to share.

You can find tons of leadership advice on the hashtag, or [read transcriptions](https://lead.srccon.org/transcription/) from the event itself.

**The week ahead:**

* Brisbane is discussing [digital journalism jobs](https://www.meetup.com/Hacks-Hackers-Brisbane/events/266060401/)
* Lagos, Benin and Abuja are talking about [why data matters](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLScOdugj-F9NEJ-S9dgffuAnledMokWguahscn1Xb9vBDuD_uQ/viewform)

**Worth a read:**

* NiemanLab compiled the results from several studies on [the neuroscience behind fake news](https://www.niemanlab.org/2019/11/galaxy-brain-the-neuroscience-of-how-fake-news-grabs-our-attention-produces-false-memories-and-appeals-to-our-emotions/) and found that humans are more likely to notice and remember new, outlandish claims over expected ones (NiemanLab)
* In an interview about data journalism tools, an NYT economics reporter [said he still believes](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/11/13/technology/personaltech/data-journalism-economics.html) "the best stories almost always emerge from talking to people" (NYTimes)
* A data reporter from NJ Advance Media [created a Github repo](https://github.com/sstirling/journo-salaries) documenting his process as he works on cleaning the data from [the media salaries spreadsheet](https://www.cjr.org/cjr_outbox/google-doc-journalism-media-pay.php) (CJR)
