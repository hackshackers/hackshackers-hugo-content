It's a new day, a new month and a new decade, hacks and hackers! Usually this would mean a [global call coming up](https://hackshackers.com/resources/global-open-call/), but we are postponing due to the call landing on a holiday for many around the world.

Now let's enjoy some brain food while we enjoy the last few days of the twenty-teens.

**Worth a read:**

* The Engaged Journalism Accelerator and On Our Radar, a nonprofit communications agency, collaborated on a report on [how newsrooms can better cover underserved communities](https://www.niemanlab.org/2019/12/here-is-a-step-by-step-guide-for-news-outlets-to-share-power-with-underserved-communities/) (NiemanLab)

* The Knight Foundation released a study [analyzing 86 million tweets](https://knightfoundation.org/articles/polarization-in-the-twittersphere-what-86-million-tweets-reveal-about-the-political-makeup-of-american-twitter-users-and-how-they-engage-with-news/) about American politics, and found that more than half of the tweets were deemed "center left" in their political ideology (Knight Foundation)
