Hello, hacks and hackers! The Associated Press just released a command-line tool called [AP DataKit](http://datakit.ap.org/) to make it easier for journalists to view and collaborate with data using standardized templates (in R or Python).

On that note, OpenNews just whipped up [a new data-review program](https://opennews.org/blog/announcing-data-review/) for lone data journalists in smaller newsrooms to be paired up with a peer coach who will help double check analyses and offer guidance.

**The week ahead:**

* London is having a [parental leave workshop](https://mailchi.mp/hackshackersldn.co.uk/parentalleaveworkshop-1490243)
* Cape Town is diving into [Facebook data](https://www.facebook.com/events/1579739528834317/)

**Worth a read:**

* Members of the Data Visualization Society discussed what traits make a data visualization elegant and wrote up their thoughts in [this Medium piece](https://medium.com/nightingale/what-makes-a-data-visualisation-elegant-fb032c3a259e) (Nightingale) 
* A [journalism-themed Hackathon in Prague](https://pressroom.rferl.org/a/rferl-hackathon-delivers-innovation-and-impact/30160313.html) gathered 93 participants to develop digital tools for independent media, and the winning project wrote a script to help verify whether Twitter trends are legitimate or artificially created by bots (RFE/RL)
* Researchers [analyzed local news stories on Facebook](https://www.niemanlab.org/2019/09/researchers-analyzed-more-than-300000-local-news-stories-on-facebook-heres-what-they-found) and found that more than half of local news on Facebook covers critical information related to health, economy and the environment (NiemanLab)
