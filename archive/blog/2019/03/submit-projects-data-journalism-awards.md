The survey is available in 14 languages and more information can be found [here](https://www.icfj.org/our-work/state-technology-global-newsrooms).

* The Open Knowledge Foundation [created an index](https://blog.okfn.org/2019/03/05/how-open-is-government-data-in-africa/) to gauge the extent to which African public institutions release key datasets as open data online and found that not one African country hit 50 percent for openness (Open Knowledge International)
* What do you do when your story has a correction? Bud Kennedy, a columnist for The Fort Worth Star-Telegram, tried an experiment where he [published his corrections as a story](http://www.niemanlab.org/2019/03/can-our-corrections-catch-up-to-our-mistakes-as-they-spread-across-social-media/) and shared them like he would a story and here’s what he found (NiemanLab)
