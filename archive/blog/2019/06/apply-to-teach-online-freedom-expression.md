Hello, hacks and hackers! The [Open Technology Fund](https://www.opentech.fund/) is looking for fellows for its [Digital Integrity Fellowship Program](https://www.opentech.fund/funds/digital-integrity-fellowship/), which provides monthly stipends to individuals who can help address threats to freedom of expression online in communities and organizations.

* Despite all Facebook’s problems with fake news (and user privacy, among other things), billions of people continue to use it, and [many don’t think fake news affects them](https://www.niemanlab.org/2019/05/its-not-me-its-you-our-facebook-fears-are-mostly-about-all-those-other-gullible-types/?utm_source=Weekly+Lab+email+list&utm_campaign=0040a25fbf-weeklylabemail&utm_medium=email&utm_term=0_8a261fca99-0040a25fbf-396331065) like it does others (NiemanLab)
