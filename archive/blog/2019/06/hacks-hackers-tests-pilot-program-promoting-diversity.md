In other news, Hacks/Hackers is launching a new pilot program. We want to see more diversity at the center of journalism and technology, and are looking for partners who could arrange conference travel, small fellowships, outreach, or any number of other projects that encourage diversity.

You can [find the application here](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLScvmn3i4GUMCvdvh6phhWm4oZOth4ImJuFBihoDaGr81FqxCg/viewform), so please let other orgs know. [Reach out to us](mailto:samantha@hackshackers.com) with any questions about the program.
