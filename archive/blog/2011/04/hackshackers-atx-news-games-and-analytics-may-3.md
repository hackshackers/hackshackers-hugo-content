Please join Hacks/Hackers ATX on Tues, May 3 at the [Texas Tribune][1], starting at 6:30pm. We&#8217;ll have refreshments sponsored by [Paintbrush Ranch Bed and Breakfast][2], thanks to Lewis Knight! We&#8217;ve decided to standardize meetings on the 1st Tuesday of each month, so mark your calendars accordingly.

We have two great presenttions for this meetup, which will deal with managing content and analytics and engaging users. First, Marcus Mateus of [SimpliTex Web Solutions][3] will discuss &#8220;Turning a Nugget of Info about Your Visitors into a Bar of Gold,&#8221; sharing some examples and data and introducing his platform.

Then, Rodney Gibbs and Michael Baird of Ricochet Labs, the makers of the News Game App [QRANK][4], will talk about &#8220;Mobile News Games: Engaging Readers with Emerging Tech.&#8221; Rodney is the CEO and Michael is the CTO, so we will get a good understanding of what it takes to develop and maintain a mobile news application. If you are not familiar yet with QRANK, it&#8217;s an addictive news/trivia game you can play on your phone, both fun and educational!

I look forward to seeing everyone on Tuesday, May 3 at the Texas Tribune. More details and RSVP at <http://meetupaustin.hackshackers.com/events/17371447>. Tell your friends. And contact Cindy Royal (croyal@txstate.edu) if you have any questions.
