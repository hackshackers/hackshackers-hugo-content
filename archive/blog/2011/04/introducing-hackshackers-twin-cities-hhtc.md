[Public Radio International][1] and [Minne*][2] are joining forces to launch the [Twin Cities Chapter of Hacks/Hackers][3].  We are excited to have our fledgling chapter join the good company of chapters spreading from the [Bay Area][4] to [NYC][5], to [Buenos Aires][6].

{{< figure link="/content-images/blog/2011/04/twin\_cities\_side1.gif" src="/content-images/blog/2011/04/twin\_cities\_side1.gif" >}}

We’ll have a kick-off happy hour at PRI’s new headquarters on Friday, April 22 at 5:30 p.m. and we’ve invited Matt Thompson, formerly of the [Star Tribune][7] and now at [NPR][8], to talk about data overload, the twilight of news brands and more.

Please help us spread the word to your networks at <http://bit.ly/HHTCkickoff>.

Hope to see you on Friday, April 22 at PRI on the top floor at 401 2nd Ave. N, Minneapolis 55401 (a peanut bag’s throw from the Twins stadium.)

Michael Skoler, PRI

Ben Edwards, Minne*
