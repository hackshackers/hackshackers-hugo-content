This will be the first large scale Hackathon organized in Armenia.

**The Hackathon[YAN] Yerevan 2011** will be aimed at finding innovative solutions  to the problems existing in Yerevan and encouraging the engagement of residents in finding solutions for them.

The result of the contest is most likely to be the creation of a number of prototypes for ready-made projects that can be implemented not only by municipal government but also by the institutions and circles focused on the city issues.

We expect to observe developments of innovative projects that will  encourage active engagement of people in the resolution of different issues that can be addressed by crowd-sourcing strategies.

**Hackathon[YAN] Yerevan 2011** is waiting for great ideas which can be submitted [here][2].

The organizers will help applicants, to form teams, to find experts or developers if needed. We will provide working space for teams, for brainstorming, developing and refining their projects before the actual **Hackathon[YAN] Yerevan 2011** contest.

Before the actual event, the organizers will also conduct meetings for applicants where the experts of various spheres will brief teams on unresolved  issues of Yerevan city, that need innovative solutions. They will consult and help teams to refine problems and ideas for enhancing projects.

**Hackathon[YAN] Yerevan 2011** will start on 17 December and will last 24 hours.

The teams made up of developers and other specialists will be given only 24 hours to develop and present to the panel a program or its prototype (demo version) aimed at solving a specific problem.

The teams will have to publicly present their programs, applications, mobile solutions and web sites to the panel on December 18.

The winners will be announced the same day.
