On Oct. 4, Hacks/Hackers ATX met at Austin American-Statesman to hear from the Statesman&#8217;s own Christian McDonald on Deconstructing the Bastrop Complex Fire Map. We were all aware of the devastation of the wildfires in early September, and the Statesman used innovative techniques to provide the community with information and coverage. Check out his video and presentation (also on [Slideshare][1]) embedded below. Links associated with the presentation are available on [Delicious][2]. 

We&#8217;d like to thank our sponsor [Home Slice Pizza][3] for donating the delicious pies. We also celebrated Hacks/Hackers ATX first year in existence. Many thanks to all who have attended our events. [Next meeting][4] is Nov. 1 at Texas Tribune.
