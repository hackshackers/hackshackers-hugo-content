Ryan Murphy, data reporter at [Texas Tribune][1], was the speaker for the November meetup of Hacks/Hackers ATX. He talked about a variety of projects that he uses in reporting publicly available information and how the Texas Tribune integrates various tools, like Google Fusion Tables, in their coverage.

The Tribune was kind enough to sponsor Home Slice Pizza for us. For December, we&#8217;ll be teaming up with some other Austin meetup groups for a holiday party. Details to come. And, in 2012, we&#8217;ll be making some changes, working together with an Online News Association Local to develop more programming and events. Thanks to everyone who has attended Hacks/Hackers ATX meetups since our inception.
