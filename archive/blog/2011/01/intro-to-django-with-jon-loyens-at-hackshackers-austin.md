For our first meeting of 2011, [Jon Loyens][1] of Bazaarvoice will be giving us an Introduction to [Django][2]. Django is a Python-based Web framework, used in many journalistic settings. It was actually developed by The World Company news organization in Lawrence, Kansas, so there will be many news and information applications to discuss. Jon is the director of Bazaarvoice Labs and does programming projects on the side.

We&#8217;ll meet at 6:30pm on Thursday, January 27th for snacks and drinks at the Texas Tribune offices at 823 Congress Ave. The building is actually around the corner on 9th St. behind the museum. The conference room is on the 2nd floor, same place where we had the meeting at the end of October. Jon will start his presentation at 7pm. Downtown metered parking is still free in the evenings, but you may have to circle around for a bit to find an available spot.

Please [RSVP][3] and mark your calendars. Contact Cindy Royal (clroyal [at] gmail) if you have any questions.
