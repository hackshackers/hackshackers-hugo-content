From intricate interactive maps to stunning visualizations, news organizations like The New York Times and Washington Post make data come alive for readers. Join [Investigative Reporters and Editors (IRE)][1], in partnership with [Hacks/Hackers][2], for NewsCamp on Feb. 24 in Raleigh, N.C., and you too can learn from the best in the business — whether you&#8217;re a rank beginner, or experienced designer/developer.

This daylong workshop will tackle subjects ranging from storytelling without words to best practices and emerging technologies. But it&#8217;s more than talk: You&#8217;ll spend the afternoon in small hands-on sessions learning how to put these theories into practice. You&#8217;ll walk away from NewsCamp with new knowledge and skills you can use right away.

[Expected speakers][3] include Martin Wattenberg, co-leader of Google&#8217;s &#8220;Big Picture&#8221; data visualization group and co-creator of Many Eyes; Michal Migurski, chief technologist of Stamen; Amanda Cox of The New York Times; Jeff Larson of ProPublica; Len De Groot of Knight Digital Media Center; and more. Hands-on sessions will be held for seasoned developers (using R to visualize data, JavaScript and more) and for those new to programming (Google Fusion Tables, timelines and instant visualization tools).

Registration for the daylong event is limited and costs only $100. Deadline to register at that price is Feb. 14, but space is limited.

NewsCamp is being held in conjunction with IRE’s Computer-Assisted Reporting Conference,Feb. 24-27, and you can attend NewsCamp and the CAR Conference for a total of $195 (until noon Central Time, Feb. 14). Registration will be available after the deadline, but at a higher rate.
