![Hacks/Hackers Hacking @ ONA11][1]

Hacks/Hackers&#8217; first annual hack day at ONA11 brought journalists and developers together to make ideas real. We built on the success of last year&#8217;s Hacks/Hackers @ ONA hack day by bringing about 45 people together in Boston. They showed up with data sets; reporting, analysis and coding skills, and a willingness to collaborate on a wide variety of ideas. In the end, ad hoc teams hatched seven projects, of which the judges gave awards to four.

Hacks/Hackers Hacking @ ONA11 was made possible by generous support from the Knight-Mozilla News Technology Partnership, the Knight Foundation, Rovi Corp., Reuters, Github, Dotcloud and Infochimps. We hope you&#8217;ll join us the day before the ONA conference in San Francisco for Hacks/Hackers Hacking @ ONA III in September 2012.
