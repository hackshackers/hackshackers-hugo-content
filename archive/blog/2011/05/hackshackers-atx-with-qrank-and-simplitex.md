On May 3, Hacks and Hackers from the Austin area got together to watch two presentations. Marcus Mateus of [Simplitex][1] discussed the role of data in creating landing pages, providing more information about users and boosting conversion rates. Then Rodney Gibbs and Michael Baird of Ricochet Labs talked about the inception of their trivia app [QRANK][2]. The meeting was sponsored by [Paintbrush Ranch][3] in Wimberley (thanks to Lewis Knight). Many thanks to the folks at [Texas Tribune][4] for arranging the location for the meeting.

Stay tuned for details about the next meeting, which will be held on June 7 at the [Statesman][5].
