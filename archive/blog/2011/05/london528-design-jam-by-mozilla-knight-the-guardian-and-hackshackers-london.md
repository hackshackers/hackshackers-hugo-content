Do you have **ideas for how news and journalism can be edgier**, cooler, and more interactive online? Are you a web developer? A designer? A news junkie with a hankering to hack?

If so, join **[Mozilla][1], [Knight Foundation][2], [Hacks/Hackers London][3] & [The Guardian][4],** on May 28 in Lond[on for an all-day brainstorm and design jam][5] about the future of journalism online.

**Qualify directly for a yearlong paid fellowship** at the Guardian, the BBC and other major news outlets by entering your idea during the jam.

Team up with innovative peers and **build prototypes** that help journalists take advantage of the open web and engage with citizens in new ways.
