How often have you thought, there&#8217;s got to be a better way to do comments? On [May 26, do something about it][1].

[Join Hacks/Hackers NYC][1] for an idea-generating session focused on creating more dynamic spaces for online news discussion with **NYU&#8217;s Clay Shirky**, **ProPublica&#8217;s Amanda Michel**, and **Ro Gupta of Disqus**.

Thursday, May 26, 2011 6:30 p.m.

[NYU, Tisch School for the Arts

][2] 721 Broadway New York, NY

What makes news valuable in the public sphere is the ability to share and talk about it. How do we improve the online experience? What features are necessary? What are the roles of names and anonymity? The dangers of crowd control and moderation? What technologies can be incorporated to surface the good stuff and manage the message mass?

Bring your best ideas for technology, design and community-building and[be prepared to share][3] — the best ideas will be invited to build working prototypes, with help from Mozilla. You can also qualify for a paid, yearlong fellowship to develop your ideas at the BBC, Boston.com, The Guardian, Zeit Online, or Al Jazeera English through the [Knight-Mozilla News Technology Partnership][4].

**[RSVP now][1].**
