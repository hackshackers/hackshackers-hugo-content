For the July meeting of Hacks/Hackers Austin, [Kristen Carney][1] of [Cubit Planning][2] discussed 7 Awesome Examples of Writing About Data That Will Drive Eyeballs To Your Site. Covering a variety of tools, Carney demonstrated the value of seven examples: landing pages, data disproving an accepted truth, analysis of social media, tweets about data, infographics, data about everyday stuff and data about making money.
