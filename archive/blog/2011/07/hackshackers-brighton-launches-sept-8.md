A new chapter of Hacks/Hackers is launching in Brighton, a city on the south coast of the UK, home to a wealth of developer and journalistic talent.

Hacks/Hackers Brighton will kick off with a meetup from 3.30-5.30pm on Thursday 8 September in the [Brighton Dome.][1]

The event will be part of the [Brighton Digital Festival][2], a month-long celebration of digital culture, and is organised by industry news and jobs site Journalism.co.uk, which has [full details of the launch meetup here.][3]

There will be talks and demos from both hacks and hackers, and ideas will be shaped by those who sign up to attend.

Suggestions so far (less than an hour after announcing the event) include mapping and visualising large geo-data sets, using APIs for journalism, and a demo of a Brighton-built Android news app.

You can make suggestions, sign up to say you are attending, offer to demo or speak, or put yourself forward to become an active volunteer at the [Hacks/Hackers Brighton meetup group][4].

There will be networking drinks in the Brighton Dome bar after the event, when we will start to talk about the next meetup.
