For the second year in a row, Hacks/Hackers and The Poynter Institute are [offering one full scholarship][1] (a $895 value!) to attend [Building News Applications With Data][2], a three-day seminar in St. Petersburg, Fla.

[Apply with this Google form.][1]

The seminar takes place Aug. 17-19, 2011. Faculty includes Hacks/Hackers co-founder Aron Pilhofer of The New York Times; John Keefe of Senior Executive Producer for News at WNYC, New York Public Radio; and Matt Waite, professor of journalism at the University of Nebraska-Lincoln and designer of the Pulitzer Prize-winning [Politifact][3] at the St. Petersburg Times; as well as other industry leaders.

The seminar is designed to help hacks and hackers better understand each other&#8217;s thinking through hands-on training.

The scholarship covers tuition only. The winner is still responsible for lodging and travel to/from St. Pete, which is near Tampa, a city with well-priced flights (especially in August!).

Applying for the scholarship is easy: Take a look at the [proposed course schedule][4], then [fill out the Google doc][1] with a pitch of up to 500 words on what you&#8217;d like to do, report on, or hack together based on what you&#8217;ll learn at the seminar.

**The application deadline is noon Pacific Time, July 18.** We may have follow-up questions for applicants. The scholarship winner will be announced at the end of July. Email scholarships@hackshackers.com if you have questions.

Last year&#8217;s scholarship winner was Corey Takahashi, who [wrote about his experience][5] at the Poynter Institute seminar.

If you have any questions, please email <scholarships@hackshackers.com>.
