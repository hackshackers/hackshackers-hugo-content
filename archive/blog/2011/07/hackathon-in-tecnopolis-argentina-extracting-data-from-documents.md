[Hacks/Hackers Buenos Aires][2] is announcing a hackathon (a day of programming between journalists and software developers) in order to work on [Mapa76.Info][3], an Internet software for the automatic extraction and visualization of data from text documents. The hackathon will take place on Saturday, August 13, in the pressroom of the mega-exhibition [Tecnopolis][4] Argentina (photo) and will focus on the trials of the last military dictatorship, which are currently in progress. ([How to get to Technopolis in Google Maps][5])

So far, Hacks/Hackers Buenos Aires has held three meetings, two in Buenos Aires (120 to 150 attendees) and a hackathon in the city of Rosario, where we worked on an interactive application in HTML5 for audiovisual media coverage as part of the [4<sup>th</sup> Digital Journalism Forum of Rosario][6]. [Hacks/Hackers Buenos Aires][2] will participate in the [Mozilla][7] meeting in November in London and will announce more hackathons soon.

From this group emerged a software project, called [Mapa76.info][3], for extracting data from the trials of the military dictatorship. The goal is to create an automatic visualization of life histories from the period 1976-1983, based on court evidence, arguments, and sentences. The software is intended to create a platform to serve as a tool for investigative journalism, history, and law.

**What will we do?**

10:30 a.m. Present the project and show the possibilities of the software.

12:00 p.m. The hackathon begins: advancing the development of the code and the accumulation of content.

**For Journalists:**

Bring documents of testimony, lawsuits, sentences, newspaper articles, etc., in text document format (.Doc, .Odt, rtf, etc.), and think of how it would be desirable to view them.

**For developers:** 

* Improve the interface for loading documents and data extraction (Ruby/jQuery)

* Improve the query interface for data (timelines, maps, document viewing) (Ruby/jQuery).  The project is developed in Ruby, Sinatra, MySQL, jQuery. The code will be released at [mapa76.info][8].

7 pm &#8211; 9 pm Presentation of results to the general public
