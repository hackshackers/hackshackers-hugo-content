The second meeting of [Hacks/Hackers Buenos Aires &#8211; Demo Day][2] will take place on June 8, and will be followed a week later on June 15 and 16 by our first [hackathon in Rosario][3], which is located 300 kilometers from Buenos Aires, as part ofthe [4th International Forum on Digital Journalism Rosario][4].

The other line of work that we propose will have to do with the challenge of geolocation and mapping data. The challenge is to demonstrate how any public document can be geo-localized, referenced, standardized. After a day and a half of work, the results of the work of **Hacks/Hackers Buenos Aires** will be presented to the public in the Digital Journalism Forum at Rosario.
