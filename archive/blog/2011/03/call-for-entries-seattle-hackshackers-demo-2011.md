Have an amazing product that is poised to transform journalism and the way we tell stories? Are you a tech start up hoping to share your million dollar idea with a group of forward thinking technologists and journalists? Developing an innovative plugin? Hacks/Hackers Seattle is organizing its first demo event at [Tableau][1] Software Tuesday, March 29 and we want to learn about your brilliant ideas.

Tableau and [Intersect][2] have already joined the lineup. We&#8217;d love to add your plugin/app/site. Just fill out this [five-minute demo form][3] and we&#8217;ll consider your company/product for one of our rapidfire presentation and Q&A sessions. (Think: Ignite or a Pecha-Kucha style presentation).

We&#8217;re looking for civic-minded demos that will help, inspire and shape the future of journalism. Join us, won&#8217;t you?

For more info, check out this post about our [kick-off event at Havana Social Club][4], [join our Meetup Group][5], and follow us on Twitter ([@hackshackersSEA][6]).
