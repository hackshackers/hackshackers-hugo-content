Join Hacks/Hackers Toronto [on March 29th for an evening of presentations, demos and chatter][1] on the topic of online communities and journalism. We have three terrific talks planned, and we have an exciting new space to host the event and foster conversation afterwards. [Craig Silverman][2], [Ivor Tossell][3], [Kim Fox][4], [Mason Wright][5], [Phillip Smith][6] are hosting.

Time: 7 p.m. March 28.

Place: [Radiolaria][7] 1166 Dundas St West Toronto, ON

Itinerary: First, [Kim Fox][8] of CBC News online and [Jennifer MacMillan][9] of The Globe and Mail will talk about different approaches to story comments — why we open stories to comments, when to allow them and factors to consider. Second, [James Walker][10] and [Paul Osman][11] will demo Salmon, an open, decentralized protocol meant to encourage commentary that is connected to original content without breaking it off into silos.

)

Finally, we will hear from [Mike Miner][13] of TVO&#8217;s The Agenda. The current affairs program has been crowd sourcing story ideas through its &#8220;Your Agenda&#8221; page, and integrates audience engagement in their journalism through &#8220;AgendaCamp,&#8221; a travelling citizen engagement project fresh off a stop in Hamilton. Mike will talk about how stories develop with

reader input. (for more info: [http://www.tvo.org/cf&#8230;][14]
