In December, we had held a [Demo Day][1] with 5-minute lightning talks (presentations) from ProPublica, OpenGovernment.org, Slate, TPM and others.

We&#8217;re holding another one on **April 5 at New Work City**, and want you to present your demonstrations of journalism and technology-related projects, software and APIs.

**Fill out** **[this form now (http://hckhc.kr/es4OQV][2])** to pitch your idea, and we&#8217;ll be in touch by March 31 to let you know if you&#8217;ll be doing a demo.

The lightning talks are 5 minutes, with a brief Q&A after each.

**[RSVP today][3] ($10, payable in advance) to attend the meetup** — this will help cover food and drinks. (We&#8217;re serving sliders! Omnivore and vegetarian.)

We&#8217;re also looking for volunteers to photograph and blog the event. If you&#8217;d like to volunteer, email us at nyc[at]hackshackers[dot]com.

If the $10 fee is beyond your budget, please email nyc[at]hackshackers[dot]com and we&#8217;ll work things out with you. We&#8217;re looking forward to seeing what you&#8217;ve got!
