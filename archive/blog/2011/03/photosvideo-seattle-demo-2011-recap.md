We kicked off our first demo event last night with a packed house at [Tableau Software][1] (our event sponsor) in Seattle&#8217;s Fremont neighborhood. More than 50 hacks and hackers packed the meeting space to learn about recent innovations at Tableau, [Intersect][2], _[The Seattle Times][3]_, [Journalism That Matters][4]-Pacific Northwest and [Microsoft Fuse Labs][5]. Guests also spent a good chunk of time eating, drinking and making connections during the fully catered (thanks, Tableau) networking session that we&#8217;re hoping will lead to some cool projects in the near future. If you missed the demo, be sure to [**check out the Ustream video**][6].

Thanks to all who showed up. We&#8217;re hoping the next meetup will combine gaming and news. We&#8217;ve also heard feedback from members interested in getting involved with a collaborative, hands-on project. We&#8217;re on it. Stay tuned for more.
