**UPDATE: [Watch][1] UStream video of the 2011 Seattle Hacks/Hackers demo beginning at 6:3o p.m. on Tuesday, March 29, 2011.**

[Free live streaming by Ustream][2]

Thanks to everyone who [submitted entries][3] for our first demo event! We received far more applications than we could accommodate for this first round. The bad news: We couldn&#8217;t possibly fit all of your presentation pitches into one event. The good news: We&#8217;re already thinking of new ways to feature innovative projects, products and ideas in the coming months! We&#8217;re still nailing down a concept but the next event may focus on news and gaming.

For those of you who scored tickets to this [Tuesday&#8217;s demo][4] at Tableau Software, here&#8217;s a  complete list of the presenters:

 [**Tableau Software**][5], Ellie Fields

 **&#8220;A New Way of Visualizing Data Online: Tableau Public,&#8221;** a free software product that journalists and bloggers can use to create and publish interactive data visualizations. Fields will look at Washington State Census data and use Tableau’s built-in geocoding to map it, put it in a dashboard and publish the visualization online. All in less than 5 minutes flat, no programming needed.

[ **Intersect**][6], Monica Guzman**

&#8220;Curation in Real Time and Beyond,&#8221;** a demo of Intersect, a social platform where people connect through experiences they chart in time and place. Learn how how journalists can tap into the platform&#8217;s context-adding features to curate rich stories from the experiences of a community&#8211;past and present.

 **[Jour][7]**[**nalism That Matters**][7], Brian Glanz

 **&#8220;Building An Online Unconference For Journalism,&#8221;** an open source publishing network with a social layer.

**&#8220;myMontage.com,&#8221;** a flexible web-based service that makes it fun and easy to create and share a visual album of the web on the topics you care about. You can design your Montage around any topic you can imagine by adding content that pulls information from a variety of sources, including RSS feeds, Twitter, Bing News, and YouTube.
