Join Hacks/Hackers ATX on Feb. 17 at 6:30pm as [Andrew Dupont][1] (of Gowalla) talks about using government data and a side project he developed called [Filibusted][2]. We know that the Internet can be used to donate to political candidates. Or make fun of them. But, with a little help from citizens, it can also make government work better. First, Andrew will present a handful of sites that aggregate government data and present it in useful ways. Then he’ll explore the process of distilling government data dumps and APIs to build your own sites.

We&#8217;ll be at the Austin American-Statesman this time. Enter parking lot via Riverside (across from Thundercloud Subs). Enter the building on the right of the entrance, room to the right of the reception area.

And, if you have any ideas about refreshment sponsorships, please let Cindy Royal (croyal [at] txstate.edu) know. A food establishment willing to donate some items or a company willing to sponsor one night would be greatly appreciated!

The March meeting will be a big social gathering during SXSW with the main Hacks/Hackers organization. Refreshments and live band! More details to come!

Hope you can make it on the 17th. Let Cindy know if you have any questions. Please [RSVP][3].

Update: The refreshments for this meeting will be delicious Banh Mi Bites from [Me So Hungry][4] (thanks to Nicole Martinez), kindly sponsored by [Mutual Mobile][5].
