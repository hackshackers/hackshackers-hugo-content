Save the date! Hacks/Hackers NYC will be hosting a News+Gaming hackathon on April 22 and 23, at [CUNY Graduate School of Journalism][1], sponsored by Seattle-based [BigDoor][2], which [offers a gamification API][3].

Plans are still coming together. But it looks like we will do a Friday night social event with talks about gaming with speakers from BigDoor and elsewhere. (Know anyone? Email nyc[at]hackshackers[dot]com with why that person is good)

Then Saturday is the daylong hackathon at CUNY in midtown.

There should be fun prizes, thanks to BigDoor.

Yes, Sunday is Easter. More details TK. Email us at nyc[at]hackshackers[dot]com with questions, comments, thoughts, ideas.
