Hacks/Hackers Austin kicked off the first meeting of 2011 with an Intro to Django session, presented by [Jon Loyens][1], Director of [Bazaarvoice Labs][2]. Loyens did a short presentation on Django as a Python-based Web framework, and then moved into a live demo. You enjoy photos and video of the session below. More photos available on the [Meetup.com][3] page. 

Once again, there was a good crowd, this time at the offices of the [Texas Tribune][4]. I&#8217;d like to thank the fine folks at the Tribune for sponsoring the refreshments for the evening.
