When WikiLeaks released the Afghanistan and Iraq war logs, news organizations and the public alike sprang into action to understand the documents.

The New York Times was instrumental in [analyzing and reporting][1] the story in articles, photographs, maps and graphic information.

Meanwhile, several local hackers worked on their own data visualizations and were featured soon after on [Wired][2], [NPR][3] and the [New York Times][4].

[RSVP now][5] to join **Hacks/Hackers NYC on March 9 at** [**New Work City**][6] to learn how the analyses were done, the importance of independent validation checks on data, and see further examples of their work.
