On Aug. 2, Hacks/Hackers ATX was joined by City of Austin Demographer Ryan Robinson at the [Austin American-Statesman][1]. Robinson detailed several of the demographic shifts that have been occurring over the past decade, providing insight into ways these trends affect our social, economic and political climate. [View his full presentation][2] for more details and watch an excerpt below.

Prior to the meeting, Christian McDonald, the Statesman&#8217;s online projects editor as well as one of the Hacks/Hackers ATX organizers, treated my [Issues in New Media][3] class to a tour of the facilities. We were also joined by online managing editor Zach Ryall and newly appointed social media editor Maira Garcia (and a graduate of Texas State) for a discussion of their online and social media operations. Thought the Hacks/Hackers family would also enjoy some of these behind-the-scenes photos.
