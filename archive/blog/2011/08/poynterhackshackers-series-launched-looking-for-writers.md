Today we’re launching a [new Hacks/Hackers series on Poynter][1].  Each week we’ll feature a [How To][2] on new tools and emerging trends in technology.

The first in the series is Katharine Jarmul, [@kjam][3], on finding and using good APIs for data. You can check it out [here][1].

Robert Hernandez, [@webjournalist,][4] and I, [@bethdavidz][5], are putting together the series with the help Poynter’s Mallary Tenore, [@mallarytenore][6], our incredible editor.

Next up, we have John Keefe, [@jkeefe][7], on mapping data onto counties, districts and other shapes and Joshua Hatch, [@hatchjt][8], on regular expression.

Interested in being next in the line-up? Let us know. We’re looking for writers. Especially those of you outside the U.S.

Know about a cool new trend? Have a tool you can’t live without? Have a sweet trick you want share? Just want to tell us how you got into tech journo tech? We’d love you to write a piece. Not only will you give back, but you’ll also get a little extra cash.

If you’re interested, contact me, Beth Davidz at bethdavidz@gmail.com.
