Hacks/Hackers began as a meetup, but the vision for the group is about more than social gatherings. There&#8217;s already been so much talk about the future of journalism. We wanted to create a community of people leading the charge and building that future.

{{< figure link="http://unite.hackshackers.com" src="/content-images/blog/2010/04/Screen-shot-2010-04-20-at-10.37.36-AM-300x57.png" >}}

We&#8217;re moving ahead with more of that plan. Hacks/Hackers is partnering with KQED, the leading public radio station in the country, to host its first workshop event May 21-23. [Hacks/Hackers Unite will be a hands-on gathering][1] to build storytelling applications for tablet devices, such as the iPad. We&#8217;re still working on the full program, and guests will include KQED and NPR developers and on-air personalities.

The event is called &#8220;Unite&#8221; because we want to unite hacks and hackers and bring together the best of journalism and technology.Â For that reason, the event will focus on storytelling, unlike a typical &#8220;hack day.&#8221; This format aims to bring journalists and developers together for all stages of the media production process to share ideas and inspiration.

We have set up a [Google Moderator site][2] for people to propose ideas and find teammates ahead of the event. We hope you&#8217;ll come prepared with stories to tell and applications to build. There will also be matchmaking at the event for people to pitch projects and find collaborators.
