For months now, [Aron Pilhofer][1] and I have been talking about a Web site where people doing computer programming in journalism could ask and answer questions, solve each other&#8217;s problems and, in general, build a supportive community. Somewhere along the way, someone said to me, &#8220;You mean, like [Stack Overflow][2]?&#8221; I went to visit the site &#8212; a thriving support community for software developers &#8212; and it looked very much like what we had in mind.

{{< figure link="/content-images/blog/2010/04/theme.logo\_.5573282.png" src="/content-images/blog/2010/04/theme.logo\_.5573282.png" alt="Help.Hackshackers.com" >}}

Though our original idea was to build a custom site, we learned that the team behind Stack Overflow had set up [a hosted service][3] for other groups interested in similar functionality. Having joined forces with [Burt Herman][4] to form [Hacks and Hackers][5], the three of us decided &#8212; with a nudge from our friends on the Chicago Tribune&#8217;s [news application team][6] &#8212; to set up a site based on the Stack Overflow software.

I&#8217;m very pleased to announce that the site is now officially launched &#8212; at <http://help.hackshackers.com>. We&#8217;re launching in &#8220;bootstrap mode,&#8221; which allows all registered users to post questions, post answers, comment, tag and rate questions and answers. Everything you do on the site is factored into the site&#8217;s reputation management system, which lets you earn points/prestige by participating actively in the community.

For the past week or so, a few of our friends and colleagues have begun participating on the site, and you can see a sense of community beginning to emerge. We&#8217;re seeing a nice mix of questions, some of them related to hard-core coding ([tagging and structuring an XML document][7]), some to more accessible topics ([WordPress customization][8]), and some to cosmic questions ([what we should call a programmer-journalist][9]). Burt and I are administering the site, and we have [Joe Germuska][10], [Greg Linch][11], [Brian Boyer][12] and [Chrys Wu][13] as volunteer moderators.

There&#8217;s just one little problem: The team behind Stack Overflow has just [suspended Stack Exchange][14], their hosted service for other sites. This caused us a small amount of panic last week, but as we read about the company&#8217;s plans, it seemed clear the goal was to keep thriving StackExchange-based communities up and running &#8212; and without requiring them to pay for the service.

Currently, our site is guaranteed to stay up through July 13. On the Stack Exchange blog, the team writes: &#8220;Community is hard to build, and we want to work with you to preserve it if you’ve already done that with Stack Exchange.&#8221; To keep this site up and running, it looks like the best approach is to demonstrate to the Stack Exchange team that we&#8217;re meeting an important need and building a thriving community.

So now it&#8217;s up to you. Please register at [help.hackshackers.com][15], post a question, post an answer, or just rate some posts. We&#8217;re counting on you.
