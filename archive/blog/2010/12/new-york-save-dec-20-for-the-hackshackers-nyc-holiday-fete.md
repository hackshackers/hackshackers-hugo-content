**Update:** RSVP now for the [Hacks/Hackers Holiday Fête][1] on Dec. 20 at [Galapagos Art Space][2] in DUMBO! Doors will open at 7 p.m. [Crave][3] will be catering the evening.

Thanks very much to our sponsors: [Gawker Media][4], [Scribd][5], <a>Soundnote</a>, [CUNY Graduate School of Journalism][6] and [Nearsay][7].

We&#8217;re still looking for some help. Contact us if:

  * Your business wants to sponsor the evening
  * You&#8217;re a video DJ who wants to take advantage of Galapagos&#8217;s projection setup
  * You want to donate prizes of assorted, sundry lots
  * You&#8217;d like to meet the Hacks/Hackers community by volunteering at the door
  * You&#8217;ve got other cool ideas to integrate into the party

Let us know at nyc[at]hackshackers.com.

Thanks!
