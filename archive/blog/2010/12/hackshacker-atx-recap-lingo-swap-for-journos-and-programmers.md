For the last meeting of 2010, Hacks/Hackers ATX hosted a lingo swap, or a terminology and process exchange, between journalists and programmers. Representing journalists was [Matt Stiles][1] of the [Texas Tribune][2]. Matt started things off by explaining what concepts like source and script mean to journalists, and demystified terms like lede and beat. Later, [Mattt Thompson][3] (yes, that&#8217;s 3 t&#8217;s), a developer from [Gowalla][4], discussed some basic programming concepts that all communicators should know. It was a great exercise in common understanding. Many thanks to both presenters! Presentations are provided below, and part of Mattt Thompson&#8217;s presentation is included as video.

This was our 4th event since starting the group this fall. We&#8217;ve had great participation so far, and I hope that will continue into next year. Look for our next meeting sometime in late January. If you have any ideas for programming, or would like to give a presentation yourself, please contact Cindy Royal (clroyal [at] gmail).

Have a great holiday and see you in 2011.
