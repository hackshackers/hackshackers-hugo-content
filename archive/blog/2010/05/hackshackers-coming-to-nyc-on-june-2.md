The word is out and already more than 100 people have signed up to attend the first Hacks/Hackers gathering in New York on June 2. Please sign up to attend at <http://meetupnyc.hackshackers.com>.

The first event will be focused on getting to know each other and assembling the wider journo-tech community to talk about what events you&#8217;d like to see in the future.

Hacks/Hackers co-founders Burt Herman and Aron Pilhofer will talk about the goals of the organization. Jennifer 8. Lee, who is helping to organize the event, will discuss her work with the Knight Foundation to support journalism innovation. Josh Cohen, senior business product manager at Google News, will also make some remarks. Folks from Patch, our main sponsor (thank you), will be discussing their approach to news and technology, as well as the skills and experience they are looking for on their product and tech teams, where they are hiring right now.

We outgrew plans to have the event at Jennifer&#8217;s loft with her famous dimsum, but we&#8217;ll be in good hands at the China Brasserie. We look forward to seeing you there!
