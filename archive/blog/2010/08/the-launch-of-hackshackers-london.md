We&#8217;re delighted to announce that the first international chapter of Hacks/Hackers got off to a fantastic start yesterday.

Having originally expected a modest turnout, we were bowled over when more than 50 journalists and coders gathered at [The Shooting Star][1] pub in Spitalfields on Wednesday evening for the first [London Hacks/Hackers meetup][2]. A big thank you to everyone who turned up!

Attendees represented a whole host of  media brands including  [The Times][3], [The Telegraph][4], [The Guardian][5], [BBC][6], [CNN][7], [MSN][8], [Reed Business Information][9] and [Emap][10].

Everyone was encouraged to put forward suggestions for future meet-ups and it looks like the next Hacks/Hackers London may start with some short sessions offering practical tips on digital journalism. However, we&#8217;re still open for hearing lots more ideas (including ways we can make the &#8216;Free Beer&#8217; idea a reality) on our [Meetup Ideas page][11].

Also keep an eye out on our Meetup page for details of the September meet. If you&#8217;re a hack, a hacker, or something inbetween, we look forward to seeing you there!
