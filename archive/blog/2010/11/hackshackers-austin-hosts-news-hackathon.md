A group of coders and journos got together for a Saturday of programming at Austin Community College&#8217;s Eastview Campus for the first Hacks/Hackers ATX News Hackathon. The day was quite productive with a variety of news apps discussed and developed over the course of the day. It was a great meeting of technology, news and academia with representation from The University of Texas, Texas State University, The Texas Tribune and many more entities.

On the [Hackathon&#8217;s Wiki][1], several resources were identified, including various tools and data sources. Matt Stiles of The Texas Tribune also shared some resources and examples on his [Delicious][2] page.

Austin&#8217;s first Hackathon resulted in several projects:

[Austin Restaurant Inspections][3] &#8211; Matt Stiles of The Texas Tribune led the group that tackled [Google Fusion Tables][4] in creating this helpful visualization.

[Texas Musician Database][5] (Rails app) &#8211; a repository of bands and musicians across Texas that can be searched and sorted by city or genre (or both). The database was scraped from the [Texas Music Office][6], as that site didn&#8217;t provide much functionality for sorting or filtering bands by genre or city. Don Cruse created the procedure for [scraping data][7], which can be found on his GitHub account, along with the [resulting files for the application][8]. Jean Vestal worked with Don on the design of the interface.

[Texas Agency Expense Data][9] (Rails app) &#8211; using data from [Texas Transparency][10], Tom Brown and his team worked on an app that presented agency expenses in a more meaningful and searchable manner. Code can be found on [Tom&#8217;s GitHub][11] account.

[Asian Population of Austin][12]: [][12]using census data, this application was created with IBM&#8217;s [ManyEyes][13]
