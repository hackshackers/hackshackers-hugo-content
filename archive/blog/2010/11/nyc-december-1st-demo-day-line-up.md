We had lots of excellent submissions for our [Demo Day][1] at New Work City. Thanks for all interest. We are sure to do it again, such that all worthy projects will gain an audience. 

Drumroll please. The Hacks/Hackers presenting on December 1.

  * Kushal Dave, FourSquare engineer, who will present an advance off-the-recordish look at the new FourSquare API. (See the [current API][2])
  * Dan Nguyen of ProPublica, who will review the data gathering and data structuring behind [Docs for Dollars][3].
  * Jeff Larson of ProPublica [uncovering financial self-dealing with a network graph][4].
  * David Moore with [OpenGovernment.org][5], a version of OpenCongress for states and cities that will be launched in public beta in December with five state legislatures.
  * Jeremy Singer-Vine with [Text Toggle][6], developed with Slate, which gives publishers an easy way to create, embed, and present interactive translations.
  * Shafqat Islam of Newscred with an experimental curation tool. ([See the live demo][7])
  * Erik Hinton & Al Shaw with the [TPM election night app][8], a high-class production made with limited resources.
  * Daniel Bachhuber with the [EditFlow][9] WordPress plug-in, now in version 0.6 which will let you control the whole editing process — from pitch to publishing — within WordPress.</ul>
