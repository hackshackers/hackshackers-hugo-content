The next meeting of Hacks/Hackers ATX (and last of 2010) will be on Dec. 8 at the Austin American-Statesman, 6:30-8:30pm. This meeting seeks to bridge the gap between journalists and programmers by explaining some of the terms and techniques of each field. [Mattt Thompson][1], a hacker at [Gowalla][2], will untangle and demystify some of the finer points of the programmer craft. And [Matt Stiles][3] of the [Texas Tribune][4] will talk about newsroom lingo and processes. So, if you don&#8217;t know the difference between a programming language and a framework, or if you have no idea what a nut graph is, this is the meeting for you.

Says Thompson: &#8220;Journalists and programmers share a lot in common: late nights at the keyboard, an obsession with grid systems, a love of data and information&#8230;heck, even the beloved aphorism &#8216;hack.&#8217; But as we know, it can be a challenge to get them on the same page. This talk aims to bridge that gap, by getting the newsroom up to speed on the parlance and techniques of the techies.&#8221;

We&#8217;ll also talk about the vast amounts and kinds of data available online, covering topics like APIs, feeds, and formats. Finally, we&#8217;ll take a look at some cool ways these technologies are combined, and how they can be integrated into journalism processes.

Food and drink will be provided (although this meeting will be non-alcoholic). But, we can plan to head to a local watering hole right after. So, before the holidays kick in, let&#8217;s get one more meeting under our belts with big plans for Hacks/Hackers ATX in 2011.
