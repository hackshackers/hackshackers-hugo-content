Journalists and developers at the first Hacks/Hackers event in Belgium launched an effort Thursday to gather information on open databases in the country and on the European Parliament and Commission.

Almost 50 people attended the event in Brussels, mostly hackers but with a strong representation from national media (like [Le Soir][1], [RTL-TVi][2], [RTBF][3] *) . 

The group is looking to hold their first hackaton in January. As an initial effort, the group decided to create a [Google doc][4] to collect URLs of open databases in Belgium and Brussels (European Parlement/Commission), which are quite lacking at the moment.
