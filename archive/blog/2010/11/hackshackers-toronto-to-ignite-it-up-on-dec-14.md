We&#8217;re happy to announce the [second gathering of Hacks/Hackers Toronto][1]. This gathering is right in the heart of holiday season, so we&#8217;re calling it a holiday gathering.

However, there will be no jolly men in red suits or mistletoe at this event, we assure you. Instead, we will have a handful of local hacks and hackers who will each entertain us with a short, [Ignite-style][2], presentation. Each presentation will explore that special place where journalism and technology collide and will &#8212; hopefully! &#8212; provide lots of fodder for conversation. After the presentations, we&#8217;ll head to a local watering hole to carry on with the merry-making.

This event is being hosted by the fine folks at [Unspace Interactive][3], and they have hinted that there might be some beverages on hand to help get us in the holiday spirit.

This is free, but you must be registered under the appropriate column. No crashers!
