We&#8217;re trying to spur ideas/collaboration among Hacks/Hackers members for the [Knight News Challenge][1], a grant program that supports news innovation that has a Dec. 1 deadline. So far more than $20 million has been granted to dozens of projects, including [Spot.us][2], [DocumentCloud][3], [Ushahidi][4] and [MediaBugs][5]. Who knows? Yours could be next.

The News Challenge gave support to [our series of hackathons across the country][6]. Inspired by the collaboration and the people we met, we&#8217;ve created [a cross-chapter Google doc][7] where you can leave thoughts/contact information/skills. Lots of people have already put ideas and talents online.

To apply for Knight, your project must use digital, open-source technology and fit into one of four categories: mobile, authenticity, sustainability and community. More about the [categories is available online.][8]

Whether you have an idea and you&#8217;re looking for a technical person, or a technical person looking for journalistic advice, here is a good place to start and to have someone help shape and critique your idea.

[The application][9] only consists of eight questions and anyone — individual, non-profit, for-profit, student — can apply from around the world.

Background: Run by the Knight Foundation, the Knight News Challenge awards up to $5 million annually for innovative projects that use digital technology to transform the way communities send, receive and make use of news and information. Recently it announced $1 million in additional funding from Google.
