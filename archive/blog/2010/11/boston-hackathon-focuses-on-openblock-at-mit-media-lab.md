About 25 people gathered at the [MIT Media Lab][1] on [October 30 for a Hack/Hackers Boston co-organized event to build geolocal apps][2] using [OpenBlock][3], an open source hyperlocal news and data gathering system based on Django. OpenBlock is based on [EveryBlock][4]. [Boston Innovation had great coverage][5] and a video, which can be seen above, which interviews Matt Carroll, of the Boston Globe, and Nick Grossman, [of OpenPlans][6], who did the heavy lifting to organize the event.

The areas they focused on included:

  * Developing new data scrapers to gather and geotag interesting Boston datasets using OpenBlock&#8217;s scraper framework and geocoder.
  * Developing widgets and related APIs to use OpenBlock data and functionality on existing or new sites
  * Adapting OpenBlock&#8217;s model to represent new data types and present data in new ways.

There were three separate groups working on apps and problems.

One example, Adam Marcus and Timothy Danford ripped the geocoder out of OpenBlock and put it up at [Tim&#8217;s github repository][7].

Another interesting project. Mahmood Ali created a rough prototype of [Amazon Machine Image][8] for OpenBlock, which would allow users to do easy configuration in minutes.

Developers were encouraged to know Python, Javascript and HTML. Familiarity with Django will be very helpful as well. However, a good non-technical contingent showed up too (yay for drawing attention) So Matt put together a brainstorming session to exchange ideas, which quickly turned into a discussion of new media and social change.

One thought re these events, from Adam: Event hosts can provide more help in maintaining project

continuity, where a person is selected by the open source organization to follow up with the projects which look promising at the end of the hackathon to help shepherd their code into (or out of, as it our case) the project.

Many thanks to the MIT Media Lab for hosting the event, and to the Knight News Challenge, which sponsored the event with a generous budget for pizza and some free swag.
