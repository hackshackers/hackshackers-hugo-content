For the next Hacks/Hackers event, we&#8217;ll be heading to Google headquarters in Mountain View to talk about [Wave][1] and potential applications for journalism. I&#8217;ll be writing more about what people have done so far in a future post and are happy to hear about ways you think it could be useful.

But for now, here&#8217;s the description for the event from our meetup site, and please go ahead and [RSVP here][2].

> Hacks/Hackers is heading to Google for an event at the company&#8217;s Mountain View campus on Wave and applications for journalism.
> 
> Launched as an early preview for developers and consumers last year, Wave blends e-mail, instant messaging and other real-time collaboration tools. The Wave team is based in Australia, led by the developers who built Google Maps.
> 
> Pamela Fox, a developer advocate on the Google Wave team visiting from Sydney, will speak about Wave and its potential applications for journalism. As always, we hope to have an interactive event with lots of audience involvement.
> 
> Please get in touch if you need a Wave invite to try it out ahead of the session. We&#8217;ll be experimenting with Wave live at the event itself as a backchannel for communication among the audience.

Meanwhile, here&#8217;s a video of Pamela talking about Wave at an Ignite event in Australia:
