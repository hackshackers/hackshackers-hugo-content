I&#8217;m excited to announce that we&#8217;re joining forces with some industry leaders working at the intersection of journalism and technology to help expand Hacks/Hackers into a wider community. [Rich Gordon][1], associate professor and director of digital innovation at the [Medill School of Journalism][2], and [Aron Pilhofer][3], editor of Interactive News Technologies at [The New York Times][4], will be helping to build Hacks/Hackers.

> We all felt this is the right idea at the right time, and look forward to bringing our different perspectives on the issue to help foster this community.

We all felt this is the right idea at the right time, and look forward to bringing our different perspectives on the issue to help foster this community. We&#8217;re hoping to plan events in other cities and also create more online resources. Please feel free to contact us if you&#8217;re interested in helping or taking part.

More details on how this came about are on the [revised About page][5], and [here&#8217;s a post][6] Rich wrote for PBS Mediashift about our collaboration.
