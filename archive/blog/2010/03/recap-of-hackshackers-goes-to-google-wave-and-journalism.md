Thanks to all who turned out at Google for our event on Wave and journalism.

If you weren&#8217;t able to make it, the archived livestream of the event is embedded below (two videos). There&#8217;s lots of info there about the concepts behind Wave as well as demonstrations of typical workflows.

Wave is incredibly complex. As member Andrew Fitzgerald [Tweeted][1] during the session, &#8220;It took Twitter months to get the 1 verb of its product into the popular lexicon. Wave has a whole new vocabulary!&#8221; There are blips, robots, gadgets and more. It&#8217;s an entirely new paradigm of communication that the Wave team hopes will become a new universal inbox.

I would have liked to spend a bit more time exploring potential uses for journalism, but all the features and explanation meant much of the session was occupied by reviewing the capabilities of Wave.

If you want to view the Wave with notes from the presentation, go to [this link][2]. Also, here&#8217;s a [blog post][3] from Joey Baker with his reflections and notes on what happened.
