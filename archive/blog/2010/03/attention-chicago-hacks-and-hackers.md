The Online News Association, the premier organization for online journalists, is holding a [meetup Wednesday night][1] (March 24), and you are invited.  It&#8217;s not an official Hacks/Hackers event, but it&#8217;s a chance to network with Chicago area online journalists. Location: the [Holiday Club][2], 4000 N. Sheridan Rd. (near Sheridan and Irving Park).

The main speaker will be [Muhammad Saleem][3], the social media director of [ChicagoNow.com][4], who will report on what he learned at [South by Southwest Interactive][5].

I&#8217;ll be there to talk up the idea of Hacks & Hackers and explore interest in some kind of Chicago event later this year.  I&#8217;ll also be happy to answer questions about the Medill School of Journalism&#8217;s [scholarship program for programmer/developers][6].  Hope to see you there.
