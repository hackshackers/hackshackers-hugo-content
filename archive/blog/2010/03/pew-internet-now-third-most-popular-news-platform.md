The Pew Internet and American Life Project is out with theirÂ [latest report on how Americans consume news][1].

There are many highlights in there, so I&#8217;ll just mention a few that are direct quotes from the report&#8217;s summary. I would strongly recommend that you read the rest for yourself.

  * The internet is now the third most popular news platform, behind local television news and national television news
  * 50% [of Americans] say they read news in a local newspaper
  * The majority of online news consumers (57%) say they routinely rely on just two to five websites for their news
> 75% of online news consumers say they get news forwarded through email or posts on social networking sites and 52% say they share links to news with others via those means

  * The most popular online news subjects are the weather (followed by 81% of internet news users), national events (73%), health and medicine (66%), business and the economy (64%), international events (62%), and science and technology (60%)
