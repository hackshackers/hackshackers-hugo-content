Asking the right questions is critical in getting compelling answers from sources, as all reporters know. A problem with online comments is that they are often unfocused and off-topic given the open nature of many commenting systems.

> Asking the right questions is critical in getting compelling answers from sources, as all reporters know.

Yahoo! researcher [Yury Lifshits][1] has built a tool called [Interview2010][2] that aims to help get better answers from readers through a structured question and answer system. The readers can share their answers through social networks, and publishers can use the content on their sites.

Yury has written up a set of questions relating to our last [panel on personalized news][3], which has already generated several responses. Go see what people have written and give your own take on the issue at [http://hackshackers.com/interviews/][4].

Hear Yury talk more about his project in this video:
