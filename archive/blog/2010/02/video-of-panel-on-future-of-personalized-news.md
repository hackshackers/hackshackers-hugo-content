Thanks to all who attended the Hacks/Hackers meetup on the Future of Personalized News! I&#8217;ll be writing more about the event in a separate post &#8212; things got a bit heated at times and there was some good debate about how to ensure quality content survives in the aggregation age. The archived livestream is below, and here&#8217;s a [written summary on Google Buzz][1] by [Abe Epton][2] of Google News. (thanks Abe!)

Photos from the event are [here][3]. (Thanks to [Todd Lappin][4] for helping with this!)

And [here are Tweets from the event.][5]
