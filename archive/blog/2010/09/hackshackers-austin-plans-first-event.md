Hacks/Hackers Austin will hold its first meetup Thursday, September 30 from 6-8 p.m. at [Austin&#8217;s Pizza][1] on the Drag (2324 Guadalupe, Austin 78705). Join us upstairs in the bar for free pizza and drinks (while drink tickets last/cash bar thereafter) and great conversation. It&#8217;s a very cool room with windows all around overlooking UT. Stay tuned for more details and surprises.

Please [RSVP][2] for this event!

The Austin chapter is the seventh group, after San Francisco, New York, Los Angeles, London, Boston and Chicago. We feel our fair city offers a great combination of communicators and technologists that will result in some amazing projects and opportunities.

Hacks/Hackers Austin is organized by [Cindy Royal][3], an assistant professor at [Texas State University &#8211; San Marcos][4], Matt Stiles and Niran Babalola of [Texas Tribune][5], Christian McDonald of the [Austin American-Statesman][6] and [Jon Lebkowsky][7], Web consultant and strategist. We plan to have monthly meetings, so let us know your ideas for future events.

Find us on Twitter at [@hackshackersatx][8] and Facebook &#8211; [Hacks/Hackers ATX][9]. If you have any questions or feedback, please contact Cindy Royal croyal [at] txstate [dot] edu.

Tell your friends&#8230; spread the word. See you on the 30th!
