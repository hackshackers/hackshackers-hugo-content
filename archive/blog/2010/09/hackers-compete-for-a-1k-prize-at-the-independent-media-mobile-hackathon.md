From iPads to Android, mobile is the future of media. But how can news organizations capitalize on mobile mania to better connect with their audiences? That&#8217;s a key question that journalists can&#8217;t answer alone.

To tackle this problem, [The Media Consortium][1], a national network of leading independent media outlets, and Hacks/Hackers are hosting an Independent Media Mobile Hackathon in Chicago from Oct 9-10.

The mission is to create mobile applications that merge gaming mechanics and news delivery. Our panel of distinguished judges will award prizes to the top three prototype applications at the end of the Hackathon, and a **$1,000 cash prize will be distributed to programmers behind the weekend&#8217;s top application.**

This is a great opportunity to get your work noticed by local and national media outlets—and score some sweet prizes including cash, ebooks, t-shirts, XKCD comics, merch from Mozilla, and more. Judges include:

  * Brad Flora, of The Windy Citizen and Knight News Challenge winner
  * Brant Houston, executive director of Investigative Reporters and Editors Inc.
  * Shinji Kuwayama, lead developer at Groupon.

**Registration has been open for just a few weeks and we&#8217;ve already sold out of journalist slots. The Hacker slots are going quickly**. If you&#8217;ve got experience developing mobile applications and are interested in journalism, [please RSVP today][2]. Please [contact us][3] with any questions.

**Hackathon Goals**

The hackathon&#8217;s call to action centers on the frame of “News + Fun + Community.” All prototype apps must focus on creatively delivering news and information via gaming mechanics, such as community engagement, video, rewards based systems, sharing, location-based opportunities, games, and more. All prototype apps created at the hackathon must be cross-platform (accessible via mobile web, tablet computer, smartphone, etc.). We are also committed to making all code generated at the hackathon open source and available immediately to all participants.

**Stay tuned for more updates about the hackathon, sponsors and prizes. And, hackers,** [**don&#8217;t forget to RSVP**][2]**!**
