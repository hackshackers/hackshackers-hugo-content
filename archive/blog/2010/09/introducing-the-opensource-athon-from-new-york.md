The Hacks/Hackers NYC is throwing an [open(source).athon in the OpenPlans penthouse][1] on Oct 2 to see how much great software for news/information we can open source in 12 hours?

If you are a hacker, bring your code and get the time and some help to push it out the door (Or bring your expertise and help others). If you are a hack, we need excellent writers and editors to help with documentation. This is a great opportunity to learn about the world of open source.

Every journo-nerd has a project they know is worth open sourcing, and that only needs documentation, or to be unbaked from a CMS, or generalized in some semi-trivial way, before they can finally push it out to a public github repo.

Maybe they just haven&#8217;t found the time. Or maybe they need a little help. Or maybe they have questions: What license should I use? How should I write my docs and structure my code so strangers can figure out how they should be contributing code? How can I release this so anybody notices and cares?

Hear about Open Source best practices from [Jeremy Ashkenas][2], lead developer at [DocumentCloud][3] and author of popular open source projects[Underscore.js][4] and [CoffeeScript][5].

Get free licensing advice from the [Software Freedom Law Center][6], authors of the GPL.

Caffeine, pizza, and snacks will be provided, courtesy of the Knight Foundation. Participants will receive a schwag bag including a copy of Karl Fogel&#8217;s [&#8220;Producing Open Source Software,&#8221;][7] published by O&#8217;Reilly, and a snazzy t-shirt designed by us. Prizes TBA.

The view from the penthouse at OpenPlans is amazing. It&#8217;s just a great place to make things happen.

We don&#8217;t want the $25 to be a deterrent. If you need a waiver, email us at nyc at hackshackers dot com, and you can volunteer for Hacks/Hackers at some point.

Also if you want to hold your own Open(source).athon, please email us! We want these events to spread.
