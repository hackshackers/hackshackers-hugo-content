Hacks/Hackers is coming to Canada.

A new Toronto chapter has been founded and its first meetup is Oct. 21 at 7 p.m. at the [Press Club][1] (850 Dundas St. W.). Those interested in attending can register at [meetupTO.hackshackers.com][2], and anyone with questions can email <toronto@hackshackers.com>.

Our goals are to facilitate the connections between Toronto’s hacks and hackers and to push the boundaries of where and how news and journalism can be part of innovative collaborations.

We’ll report back after the first event, but for now here’s a look at the group organizing Hacks/Hackers in Toronto. (Also, anyone interested in helping with a Montreal chapter can email me at craig at craigsilverman.ca.)

The Toronto team:

[Craig Silverman][3] is the digital journalism director of [OpenFile.ca][4], a collaborative local news website for Canada, the managing editor of PBS MediaShift, and a columnist for Columbia Journalism Review, the Toronto Star and BusinessJournalism.org.

[Phillip Smith][5] is a dedicated convener and digital craftsperson. For more than 10 years, he has focused on supporting the work of independent publishers and &#8220;movement media.&#8221;

[Ivor Tossell][6] is a reformed web programmer who took up words instead, and has been writing about online culture, technology, and other subjects in the Globe and Mail for the last five years.

[Mason Wright][7] is a jack-of-all-trades journalist with 15 years&#8217; experience as a writer, reporter, copy editor, web editor, photo researcher and more. Currently he is the evening online news editor at The Globe and Mail, in charge of the homepage at [globeandmail.com][8].
