On October 16, Hacks/Hackers ATX presents a day-long Hackathon bringing journalists, news bloggers, and government employees together with technology developers to create data-driven news applications, seeking and making sense of open data available from the State of Texas and other sources. The day will start with examples of data-driven news presented by Matt Stiles and Niran Babalola from the [Texas Tribune][1]. Then communicators and developers will form groups to define and build applications from sources such as <http://www.texastransparency.org/opendata>.

Lunch will be served (courtesy of [Community Impact Newspaper][2]). Other sponsors include [EFF-Austin][3], [GNI Strategies][4], [Hacks/Hackers][5], funded by the [Knight Foundation][6], [Midas Networks][7], [Plutopia Productions][8], [Texas Observer][9], and [Texas Tribune][1].

Please [RSVP][10] for this event.

**When?**

Saturday, October 16, 9am-4:30pm

**Where?**

Austin Community College’s terrific Eastview Campus

3401 Webberville Road, Building 8000

**Who should come?**

  * Journalists, bloggers, and other strong writers and communicators who understand the power of technology, but don’t know where to start in taking raw data and transforming it into newsworthy information.
  * Technology developers looking for an opportunity to build meaningful, world-changing solutions. We also need designers and technical writers to help design and document the applications we build.
  * Government employees and officials who want to spread the word about the data they&#8217;ve already released, and learn what is necessary to provide the most useful data to the public.

**What will you do?**

  * The plan is to identify publicly-available, readily accessible data sets – see <http://www.texastransparency.org/opendata/>
  * Journalists and bloggers will brainstorm with technology developers, creating ideas for applications using the available data, and building those applications.
  * This partnership of people who develop news and people who develop technology will produce workable applications that will be placed online for the anyone to see and use.
  * At the end of the day, judges will select the best applications.
  * Bring your computer, we’ll have great wifi.
