_This is a guest post that also appeared on Oct. 15 on ProPublica&#8217;s blog at <http://www.propublica.org/article/how-we-use-mechanical-turk-to-do-data-driven-reporting-and-how-you-can-too> by Amanda Michel ProPublica_

Of all of journalism&#8217;s recent evolutions, data-driven reporting is one of the most celebrated. But as much as we should toast data&#8217;s powers, we must acknowledge its cost: Assembling even a small dataset can require hours of tedious work, deterring even the most disciplined of journalists and their editors.

Fortunately, there&#8217;s an affordable &#8212; and amazing &#8212; tool that can make the impossible easy: [Amazon&#8217;s Mechanical Turk][1] (mTurk).

For those unfamiliar with Mechanical Turk, it&#8217;s an online marketplace, set up by the online shopping site Amazon, where anyone can hire workers to complete short, simple tasks like [quickly transcribing interviews][2], [copying data from thousands of charts][3], and [even sorting through satellite images in hopes of locating missing individuals][4]. Amazon originally developed it as an in-house tool, and commercialized it in 2005. The mTurk workforce now numbers more than 100,000 workers in 200 countries.

At the urging of [Panos Ipeirotis][5], a professor at New York University&#8217;s Stern School of Business, we began experimenting with mTurk last spring to clean, de-duplicate and reformat data. We&#8217;ve since used the tool to collect or proof more than 28,000 data points, from the names of [companies that received stimulus money][6] to the categorization of answers to our [home loan modification questionnaire][7]. We&#8217;re impressed with the speed and accuracy of its results. For example, a project we estimated would take a full-time staffer almost three days to finish was completed on mTurk overnight for $37, with 99 percent accuracy.

Mechanical Turk has proven to be more than a shortcut. It has freed up staff time for more complicated work. We&#8217;ve also used it to retrieve data from government databases that prohibit scraping.

We&#8217;ve summed up our knowledge of the tool and lessons learned in this guide, [ProPublica&#8217;s Guide to Mechanical Turk][8]. A lot of credit also goes to Professor Ipeirotis, who has answered many of our questions and reviewed our initial mTurk projects.
