[Hacks/Hackers][1] is teaming up with [Mozilla][2], the [open-source-oriented][3] nonprofit, to creating a course through [Peer-to-Peer University][4], with the aim of collective eduction: the hackers teaching the journos, and vice versa.

The idea won a $1,000 seed prize at MIT&#8217;s [Future of News and Civic Media conference][5] in June. That contest gave the $2,000 seed money for Hacks/Hackers in 2009.

The class will be a six-week commitment, with one hour a week of lectures and one project. It will cover a broad range of topics, and instructors will (tentatively) include NYT interactive guru and Hacks/Hackers honcho [Aron Pilhofer][6], [Amanda Hickman][7](teaching about mapping), and [David Cohn][8] (instructing students on online collaboration). Nieman Lab [did a write-up][9] when it won a prize at the MIT Future of Civic Media conference.
