An astounding 170 folks showed up at last week&#8217;s inaugural Meetup on June 2 at Chinatown Brasserie to enjoy the dim sum (thanks to Patch).  We [uploaded photos][1], taken by Jigar Mehta, so feel free to tag them.

What we appreciated was that it was a pretty even balance of hacks and hackers, not to mention men and women. That&#8217;s New York City for you.

**Plans**

Lots of  ideas came our way. We hope these will all happen sometimes in the next few months. Watch our calendar.

  * A hackathon of sorts.
  * A &#8220;speed-dating&#8221; event between hacks and hackers so they can meet each other and see what they are working on.
  * A demonstration of YouTube&#8217;s lates work regarding news (The head of their news and politics team now works out of Google&#8217;s New York office).
  * A briefing about the New York Times &#8220;Moment in Time&#8221; project, which gathered 10,000 photos from around the world.
  * A demo session for different content-related startups.

In addition, we&#8217;d like to get a talk about design and usability, if anyone has any suggestions for speakers/format/topic.

As these get more traction, we&#8217;ll put out a call for volunteers. Also bring us more ideas, we&#8217;ll probably let you run with it. Email the organizers at nyc at hackshackers dot com.

**Spaces & Venues**

Thanks also to Meetup, Gawker and Gotham Schools for volunteering venues for future gatherings. Space donations are always welcome — especially if capacity is greater than 100.

**Survival Glossary**

Last, but not least, Hacks/Hackers is putting together a crowd-sourced survival glossary that it will release under a Creative Commons license to sits like Poynter.org. [Take a look][2], and see if you have something to add/tweak.
