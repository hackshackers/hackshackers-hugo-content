We&#8217;ve scheduled [our next New York City Meetup][1] (more in the works!) at Meetup&#8217;s HQ.

[Scott Heiferman][2], the chief executive of Meetup, will [not crush an iPad with a sledgehammer][3] for us, but he will give a talk on his vision of news and information: Why the future of social media isn&#8217;t media. How journalism and media will shape the 21st century by catalyzing community like never before.

Plus we&#8217;re looking for three or four short (~5 minutes) demos. Email nyc[at]hackshackers[dot]com if you would like to present.

Meetup&#8217;s auditorium fits about 70 people max, so we will maintain a waiting list.

We&#8217;re charging $10, in part to cover the drinks and yummy food. Suggestions for kinds of food welcome. If you have trouble with the cost (student?), please email us, we don&#8217;t want the $10 to be a deterrent. You can volunteer to help with set-up and cleanup.
