description: 'Daylife offered Hacks/Hackers members a challenge: crerate an application
  with the Daylife API that one of their publishing clients wants to buy, and you
  will get to keep 70% of the revenue. '

Let the API challenges begin. As part of his presentation at the Hacks/Hackers NYC Meetup yesterday, Vineet Gupta (<vineet@daylife.com>) of [Daylife][1] offered [a special challenge][2] just for Hacks/Hackers members nationwide:

  * You hack an application with the [Daylife API][3], which receives over one billion calls per month, that a publisher may want to enhance their site (e.g. neat visualizations, search user interfaces, alerts or personalization).
  * Daylife supplies the API, hosting, and markets to their clients
  * And if any client bites, proceeds are split 70% (to the hacker) / 30% (Daylife)

Interesting. Some context: Daylife, a 26ish-person company led by [Upendra Shardanand][4], is an aggregator who offers a range of products to publishers, including [self-updated curated topics pages][5]. For example, this is a [Daylife-powered page on Forbes.com of][6] [Mark Zuckerberg][6].

Daylife tracks some 50,000 streams of content from 15,000 sources, tagging articles and stories as they appear. It&#8217;s much more of a B2B play, than a consumer-facing company, which is why you may have come across their service without realizing it. [Their clients][7] include traditional media outlets (like [NPR][8] and [Washingtonpost.com][9]) and standalone brands that feel a need to have fresh contents on their Websites ([treehugger.com][10] and Roadrunner). It seems everyone wants to be a publisher now to keep their websites fresh, and that requires content.

The Daylife API allows you to pivot around topics, people, date range, specific searches, quotes. Daylife even [offers some fun ideas for projects][11] that they were — ahem — too lazy to build themselves: [newsmakers plotted on a map][12]; a [fashion tracker][13], maybe for Fashion Week; a [celebrity tracker][14]; and our personal favorite is probably the [top 10 dictators of the world][15].

So far the company raised $15 million in funding, [including $4 million from Getty Images][16]. Investors include [The New York Times][17], Michael Arrington of [TechCrunch][18], John Borthwick of [Betaworks][19], Ron Conway of SV Angels, [Scott Heiferman][20] of [Meetup][21], Ken Lerer, and [Craig Newmark][22] of [Craigslist][23].

To get started: here are some [basic concepts to the Daylife API][24]. For those of us who are more hacks than hackers, you can try [the API without writing a line of code][25] (but first you will still need to [apply for an API key][26], takes about a day). This is a pretty straightforward API with fairly rich offerings, and their documentation is pretty robust. So it&#8217;s a good project to practice with if you are new to APIs.
