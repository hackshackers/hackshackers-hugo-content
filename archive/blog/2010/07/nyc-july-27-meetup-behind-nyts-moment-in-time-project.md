The Meetup at Meetup now has a waiting list, but don&#8217;t despair. We have a bonus Meetup this month (before August) in a gorgeous penthouse space!!

**What**: [Behind the 10K+ photos in The New York Times&#8217; Moment in Time Project][1]

**When**: Tuesday, July 27, 2010 7:00 PM

**Price**: $5.00 per person (no planned refreshments)

**Where**: Open Plans Penthouse

148 Lafayette St. 12th Fl.

New York, NY 10013

212.796.4220

Come behind the scenes in [The New York Times &#8220;Moment in Time&#8221; project][2], which generated 14,000 photo submissions from around the world chronicling an instant on May 2, 2010.

It was a project which pushed the boundaries of technology, photography, and community. Listen to those who conceived, built, publicized and synthesized what turned out to be a project of global scope. You will hear about project&#8217;s ups, downs, hurdles, and surprises.

Speakers include [Zach Wise][3], multimedia producer; [Jim Estrin][4], photographer; and potentially others in the team (hopefully [Jacqui Maher][5], the interactive news developer who is the Queen of Stuffy).

<For the hackers> This was the first major use of [Stuffy, the Times&#8217; latest-generation reader submission system][6]. Stuffy is a “NoSQL” storage engine to make customized forms very simple. It uses Ruby on Rails and MongoDB. </hacker stuff>

We&#8217;re superlucky this month because we got the Open Plans&#8217; beautiful penthouse space (thanks to Elizabeth Green and [Gotham Schools][7]). It&#8217;s worth coming to the Meetup just to experience it. Take a look [via an online profile.][8]

This Meetup will not have planned refreshments, so it&#8217;s only $5. But if price is a hurdle (student?), email nyc[at]hackshackers[dot]com. We don&#8217;t want the cost to be a deterrent. You can volunteer with registration or something.
