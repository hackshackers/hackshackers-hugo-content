Hacks/Hackers and The Poynter Institute are offering one full scholarship (a $795 value!) to attend the institute&#8217;s three-day seminar in St. Petersburg, Florida: Programming for Journalists / Journalism for Programmers (More info at <http://hckhc.kr/doUlhi>). The seminar takes place from August 25-27, 2010. Faculty includes Hacks/Hackers co-founder Aron Pilhofer of The New York Times; Matt Waite, who designed the Pulitzer Prize-winning Politifact at the St. Petersburg Times; and other industry leaders. It&#8217;s designed to help hacks and hackers better understand each other &#8216;s thinking through hands-on training.

To be clear, the scholarship is just for the tuition. You are still responsible for travel to/from St. Pete. But it&#8217;s near Tampa, which generally has well priced flights (especially in August!)

To apply for the scholarship, we&#8217;re making this super easy. Please write a pitch of up to 500 words on what you&#8217;d like to do/report on/hack together based on what you&#8217;ll learn at the seminar. The deadline is July 24. We might have follow -up questions. We&#8217;ll notify everyone by the end of July.

If you have any other questions, please email <scholarships@hackshackers.com>.

Of course you can always directly apply too.
