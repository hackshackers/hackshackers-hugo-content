Hacks/Hackers goes to the heartland with its [new Chicago chapter][1].  This will be spearheaded by Rich Gordon, a Northwestern prof who is one of the original founders of Hacks/Hackers, and [Tracy Schmidt][2] of ChicagoNow.

We have high expectations for our Chicago chapter with Tracy&#8217;s organizing prowess and Rich&#8217;s Northwestern connections.

We&#8217;re still looking for organizers for other chapters: Austin? Seattle? DC?  Email burt@hackshackers.com if you&#8217;re eager.
