We&#8217;re delighted to announce that freelance journalist [Corey Takahashi][1] is the winner of the Hacks/Hackers scholarship to Poynter&#8217;s [workshop on programming for journalists / journalism for programming][2].

Based in Los Angeles, Corey is planning to apply the digital skills from the Poynter workshop to [revisit demographic trends that he wrote about during the 2000 Census][3] through a data-focused lens. As part of his trip, Corey also will create a video reflecting on what he learns at the workshop and lessons from bringing together the cultures of journalism and programming &#8212; and we&#8217;ll be sure to post that here.

Corey&#8217;s career has taken him across the entire media spectrum as he has stayed on the cutting edge of journalism. He started as a founding editor at hiphop magazine Blaze, and later worked for [Vibe][4], [Entertainment Weekly][5], [Newsday][6] and New York Public Radio. He then moved from print to broadcast and has been a contributor to [NPR][7], the CBC and the BBC/PRI/WGBH newsmagazine, The World. He&#8217;s a fully multimedia journalist who works across all formats.

Thanks to all the applicants for taking the time to write out their pitches. We were excited to see the range of different people who applied — from college students to hacktivists to full-time freelancers &#8212; and the range of ideas. More opportunities soon.

Please join us in congratulating Corey!
