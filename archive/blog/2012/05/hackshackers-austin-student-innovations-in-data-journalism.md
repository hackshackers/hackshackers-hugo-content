On May 21st, Hacks/Hackers Austin, along with the local Online News Association group, met to discuss student projects practicing data journalism. Jake Batsell of SMU joined us, along with one of his students, Natalie Posgate, to discuss their award-winning Campus Crime project associated with the Light of Day project. Ryan Murphy of Texas Tribune also participated in the presentation, as he and Matt Stiles (now with NPR) assisted the SMU group at the outset of the project. Watch the video below and check out the [links from Jake&#8217;s presentation][1].

Afterward, Cindy Royal and several of her students presented the results of their [Texas State of Change][3] project. The project was funded by a grant provided by [AEJMC and the Knight Foundation][4]. The students worked with the [VIDI Drupal modules][5] developed by the Jefferson Institute, among other tools including Google Charts, JQuery, HighCharts.com, ManyEyes and others, to create a site telling the story of Texas State University&#8217;s recent designation as Hispanic Serving Institution. The students who attended &#8211; Sara Peralta, Shannon Delaney, Ashley Hebler and Joe Vasquez &#8211; discussed their roles and impressions of the project. You also read about the course and grant activities at [advanced.cindyroyal.net][6]. Video of the presentation is below.

Both groups of students had memorable and valuable experiences in working with data and have great skills with which to enter the working world!

Many thanks to the Statesman for letting us use their facility once again. And thank you to Jacie Yang of Texas State for shooting video and taking photos at the event.
