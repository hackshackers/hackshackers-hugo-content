The Spring of 2012 has been a busy one for Hacks/Hackers ATX. Here&#8217;s a rundown of the past three events. With a new collaboration with the local Online News Association group, we have broadened some of the topics we are able to present. In February, we hosted a panel on Twitter and TV News featuring Sara Talbert, a reporter for Fox Austin; Michael Spurlin, a producer for MyFoxAustin.com; Rebekah Hood, the web editor for KVUE.com; Nick Blackhall, a web editor for KVUE.com. Rob Quigley of UT moderated.

In March, Austin is the place to be, with SXSW bringing thousands of tech, music and film enthusiasts to town. Hacks/Hackers, along with Online News Association and several other organizations, sponsored a big event at Palm Door, the return of the [Awesomest Journalism Party. Ever.][1]

TXST students took a break from the [SXTXState.com][2] coverage to enjoy the party.

For the April meeting, once again in conjunction with ONA, the topic was Producing Great Video for the Web. It featured Jorge Sanhueza Lyon of [KUT-Austin][3] (formerly of Austin American-Statesman) and Burnie Burns, the founder of [Rooster Teeth Productions][4], the company that makes the web series Red vs. Blue. See video excerpts (not great video &#8211; sorry for the poor lighting) of their presentations below.
