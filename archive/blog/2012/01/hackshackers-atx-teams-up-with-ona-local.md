Happy New Year! Exciting changes are in the works for Hacks/Hackers ATX in 2012, joining up with a newly formed [Online News Association][1] local group. The two organizations hosted a debut meetup at [Opal Divine&#8217;s Penn Field][2] on January 5 to kick off the collaboration. The plan is to broaden the scope that was originated by Hacks/Hackers ATX since September 2010, but adding content that addresses general online news issues, while retaining the Hacks/Hackers presence in data, programming and user experiences.

The organizing group includes people from Texas State University, The University of Texas, Austin American-Statesman, Texas Tribune, local television stations and bloggers. Above, Rob Quigley, senior lecturer at UT, kicks off the event. Plans are to hold meetings on the fourth Monday of each month, with the first planned for Feb. 27. Details and location to come. For more information, join the [ONA Austin Meetup group][3], follow on [Twitter][4] or [Facebook][5]. All meetings and events will also be posted on the Hacks/Hackers links ([Meetup][6], [Twitter][7], [Facebook][8]).

With more than 60 people attending the debut meetup, the joint group is off to a great start!

In other news, Hacks/Hackers ATX enjoyed co-hosting the Austin [Holiday Web Bash][9], along with 18 other local meetup groups, at Buffalo Billiards on Dec. 13. The event, which collected food and donations for the [Capital Area Food Bank][10], was attended by more than 500 area programmers, developers, designers, instructors and overall Web enthusiasts. It was a great time and a great success.
