Since the start of Hacks/Hackers in 2009, we&#8217;ve heard from lots of people interested in the ways journalists and developers can help each other push what&#8217;s possible at the intersection of news and technology.

So we&#8217;re very pleased to kick off 2012 with the new version of [**Help by Hacks/Hackers**][1], a forum for you to ask and answer any practical, forward-looking, and philosophical questions about news and media work.

To get started, [**log in**][2]. If you had an account on the old Help By site and need to reset your password, [**do so here**][3]. And if you have any technical problems with the site, email us at HelpBy [at] hackshackers.com.

A big thank you goes to [Ben Balter][4] for porting the data and setting things up on the backend.

Happy New Year everyone!
