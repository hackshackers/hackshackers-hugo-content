![][1]**Developers and journalists gather for the first Hacks/Hackers São Paulo hackathon.**

[Hacks/Hackers São Paulo][2] held its first hackathon on Oct. 20 during the [W3C Brazil Conference][3], alongside the [2012 PERL international community conference][4]. The hackathon, which drew about 50 people, happened during Web.br, an important gathering of the tech community in Brazil.

The hackathon attracted a large number of developers and a few journalists. Nevertheless the mix was right, as journalists helped different groups with their data mining skills. W3C, which joined ICFJ, OKFN and Abraji to create Hacks/Hackers São Paulo, also provided a team of front-end developers who helped refine hackathon ideas and improve the overall output.

Six hack groups formed and presented the following projects:

**Transpolítica**

[Kako Fernandes][5] and [Raphael Agnelli][6] created a graphical interface for a large dataset about congressional cabinet spending.

**University student profiles**

Hacker [Diego Rabatone][7] led a project to create an application that gives graphical interpretation of data released by the University of São Paulo. [The code is on GitHub][8].

**Para onde foi voto (Where My Vote Went)**

Raphael Molesin improved on a project created during a previous hackaton. This time, he aggregated new data about [local politicians&#8217; spending and personal wealth][9].

**Senado.cc**

Hacker Vitor Batista basically managed to hack all the Brazilian senate&#8217;s so-called open data and he plans to dump it into a more friendly website, [Senado.cc][10].

**São Paulo Hackdash**

Rogérios Alcantara and friends proposed adapting a platform that collects ideas for future hackathons. It&#8217;s inspired by the Hacks/Hackers Buenos Aires [HackDash][11].

**Esplanada Aberta**

This is a project by W3C professionals who have drawn a styled map of Brasilia&#8217;s main avenue &mdash; the place where our government ministers work &mdash; and then mapped the status of Brazil&#8217;s Freedom of Information laws by each government department.
