For its second session hosted by Qunb, Hacks/Hackers Paris focused on APIs. The first presentation, by [Aurélien Fache][1] from [faberNovel][2] explained what is an API and what it will be in the years to come. Afterward, Radio France and [UPIAN][3] showed an innovative use of the [Storify API][4] for their website &#8220;[Clichés de campagne][5].&#8221;

&#8220;Everything is API, API is everywhere&#8221; could be a good summary [for Aurélien Fache&#8217;s presentation][6]. &#8220;An API is a interface to share information between two systems,&#8221; he said. Then, he showed some examples: [withings.fr][7] converts weight via API, and [Cosm][8] uses and API to monitor radioactivity in Fukushima, Japan. &#8220;There will be 250,000 APIs in 2014. The main output formats are xml and json, they are both machine-readable and user-readable,&#8221; he said. He then showed some tools to make JSON easier to read: [Json Parser Online][9], and [Mr. Data Converter][10] by Shan Carter of The New York Times.

To conclude, Fache talked about &#8220;liquid medias&#8221; and &#8220;media as an API&#8221;: &#8220;The media should be liquid to be readable on all platforms: mobile, web, print, TV, etc.&#8221;

The second presentation was about &#8220;[Clichés de campagnes][5]&#8221; and other websites made by UPIAN and Radio France this year using the [Storify API][11]. &#8220;We thought we could mix professional photography with social media content. Better than a live-tweet, Storify was the tool for that. It&#8217;s a curation, made by a journalist. We could have used the API of each social media website, but Storify is already doing that,&#8221; the presenters said. Storify was a great tool to gather Twitter, Youtube, Soundcloud, text and more. &#8220;The good thing is that we could make a tool without thinking about the CMS. One of the side effect is that Storify can have some problems. So we downloaded the json given by Storify&#8217;s API.&#8221;

The result was so great, said Xavier Meunier of Radio France, that they decided to use it on other subjects. It&#8217;s not random content, it&#8217;s curated content. &#8220;This tool won&#8217;t replace breaking news or analysis, but it&#8217;s a new thing to keep in our toolbox. It was an opportunity to incorporate sounds, Radio France&#8217;s trademark. The result worth the work, as we continue for the elections in the USA,&#8221; he said.

After that, Webshell, which calls itself API of the APIs, presented [their product][12] and [ToS;dr][13], a website they made to highlight complexity of terms of service for APIs.

The API will be discussed in Paris during [Apidays][14], Dec. 3-4.
