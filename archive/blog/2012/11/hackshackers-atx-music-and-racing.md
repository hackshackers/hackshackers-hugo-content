The September and October meetings of Hacks/Hackers ATX (in conjunction with the Online News Association local), focused on topics around important parts of Austin culture. In September, the group talked about Music Apps and Blogging, featuring Daniel Senyard and Shannon Delaney of [Vivogig][1] and Ian Morales and AJ Miranda of [Red River Noise][2] and [Austin Vida][3]. Vivogig is a photo-sharing app focused on concert experiences and Red River Noise and Austin Vida are music blogs covering important aspects of the diverse music scene. [Maira Garcia][4], formerly of Austin American-Statesman but now at The New York Times, organized the panel and moderated.

The October meetup focused on Covering the Circuit of the Americas. This is a new event for Austin. Taking place Nov. 16-18, the international crowd that enjoys Formula One racing will descend on our city. It is expected to draw 200,000 race fans and onlookers, bigger than both SXSW and Austin City Limits Festival. Kevin and Kerri Olsen of the blog [Austin Grand Prix][5] and [Dave Doolittle][6] of Austin American-Statesman discussed their plans for covering the inaugural event.

Both talks were held at the Austin American-Statesman, with the Statesman sponsoring the September meetup and the UT School of Journalism sponsoring October.
