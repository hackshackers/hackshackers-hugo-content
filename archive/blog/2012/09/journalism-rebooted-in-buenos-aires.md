Around 700 people attended the three-day [Hacks/Hackers BA Media Party][1], at Ciudad Cultural Konex, averaging around 400 participants per day. The largest gathering of journalists, editors, designers and software developers in Latin America brought together people from the interactive teams of [The New York Times][2], [The Guardian][3], and [ProPublica][4], plus 20 international speakers from three continents and various countries in the region, including Colombia, Chile, Perú, Uruguay, Brasil and Guatemala, and digital editors from all of the largest Argentine media organizations.

The first two days involved 23 parallel workshops and the third day was a huge hackathon, where 250 people worked on eight projects. The Media Party was the largest event in the history of Hacks/Hackers at the global level, and captured the attention of the local and international press. Also at the event, [Daniel Sinker officially announced a new round of Knight-Mozilla Open News Code Sprint Grants][5] that will offer up to $10,000 for projects related to innovation in journalism. The event’s website: [http://mediaparty.hhba.info][6]

Among participants were members of the interactive news team at [The Guardian ][6](Alastair Dant, Mariana Santos, Alex Graul and Nicola Hughs), who gave a keynote and a workshop on interactive news; Tyson Evans of [The New York Times][6]; Justin Arenstein, media strategist and consultant for Google and [ICFJ][6]; and Dan Sinker, director of the program [Knight Mozilla Open News][6]. Workshops were also given by Al Shaw ([ProPublica][6]), Thomas Levine ([ScraperWiki][6]), Jonathan Stray ([Overview][6]), Karen Reilly ([Tor][6]), James C Burns ([Zeega][6]), Rob Baker ([Ushahidi][6]) and Douglas Arellanes (Sourcefabric), who also gave support to the HHBA Media Party website, together with local projects. Furthermore, we kicked off the Data Journalism Handbook for Latin America, proposed by Poderopedia, and presented a preview of CryptoPeriodismo, Pablo Mancini&#8217;s book. Additional attendees included the [Knight Fellows][7] [Gustavo Faleiros][6] from Brasil, [Sandra Crucianelli ][6]from Argentina, [Ronnie Lovler][6] from Colombia. And also Miguel Paz from [Poderopedia][6], plus dozens of regional groups.

Among local projects presented in the Media Fair were Atlas Electoral, Chequeado, Mapa76, Comenta.TV, DocuMedia, Educabilia, FOPEA, La Nación Data, Poderopedia, Tuiter, The Real Time, Viflux, ShowTimeLine! and Zauber.

Projects that were conceived of or developed during the hackathon, a collaborative working day between journalists and programmers, will be specially considered by the [Knight Prototype Fund][8] program, which provides grants of up to $50,000 for media innovation.

The [Media Party][6] was organized by [Hacks/Hackers Buenos Aires][6], the largest **Hacks/Hackers** community in South America and the second largest in the world after New York (in quantity of members) The BA chapter surpasses chapters in San Francisco, London and Boston. [**Hacks/Hackers**][6] is a space for exchange between journalists and programmers to collaborate on constructing the future of news. It is the best meeting place in the world to build relationships and collaborate on products, services and ideals between journalists and technologists. It was created by Burt Herman (Storify), Rich Gordon  (Stanford) and Aron Pilhofer of The New York Times.

The event also included a visit by the [LibreBus ][6]ConoSur, a project being run in collaboration with[ Creative Commons][6] and[ Mozilla][6], which involves a bus of activists traveling through Latin America to share ideas surrounding free culture and free software.
