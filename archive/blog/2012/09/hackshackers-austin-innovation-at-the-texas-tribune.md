On August 20, Hacks/Hackers ATX, along with the local ONA group, got together at the [Texas Tribune][1] to discuss innovation. Rodney Gibbs, Chief Innovation Officer, and developer Noah Seger discussed the progression of Texas Tribune since it&#8217;s inception in 2009. Over the past three years, the organization has developed some of the most popular and heavily visited data projects including the [state government salaries database][2] and most recently, the [Public Schools Explorer][3]. It was a great group of professionals and students, and a lively discussion ensued.

Refreshments were sponsored by longtime member and UT Ph.D. student Lewis Knight. Thanks Lewis!

We&#8217;re working on some interesting topics (music-themed and Formula 1) for the next couple meetings with ONA. Stayed tuned to the [meetup site][4] for more info.
