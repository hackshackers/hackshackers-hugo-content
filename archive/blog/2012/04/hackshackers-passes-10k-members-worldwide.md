Hacks/Hackers has surpassed the 10,000 member mark just two and half years after its start as a Meetup group in the Bay Area. Due to the passion of journalists and technologists like you, we now have groups holding regular events on four continents. And the >10,000 members on meetup.com don&#8217;t even reflect the new chapters being created in parts of the world that aren&#8217;t using Meetup.com for organization, such as in Africa and the Middle East.

People have found jobs, co-founders for startups, acquirers for their company, learned new skills, hacked out projects, shown off their work and so much more at Hacks/Hackers events. We want to celebrate your achievements as we look to the future and doing so much more. Please send Tweets, photos, Facebook updates or any other media with a story about what you&#8217;ve gotten out of Hacks/Hackers using the hashtag #10kHacksHackers and we&#8217;ll add it to the Storify story below.

Like all of you, we see amazing opportunity in this time of media revolution and believe the future will be built by bringing together the best of journalism and technology. With 10,000 members, we&#8217;re only getting started.
