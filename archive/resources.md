Hacks/Hackers aims to bring together journalists and technologies. As such, it is compiling or creating resources to help.

**The [Hacks/Hackers Survival Glossary][1]** is aÂ crowdsourced explanation of terms that help us understand the technologies involved in modern content distribution. Don&#8217;t know Drupal from Django, API from Ajax, mashup from metadata? This is the list for you. It&#8217;s written for intelligent nontechies in (mostly) plain English. Feel free to distribute or contribute. Since being [put up on Poynter Online][2], it has proved so popular that it accounts for several percentage points of traffic every day. The list is currently being translated into French and Arabic.
