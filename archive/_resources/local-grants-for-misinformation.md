Thanks to the Mozilla Foundation and its efforts to fight misinformation on the web, Hacks/Hackers is offering small grants for local chapters to hold events related to misinformation.

We will be distributing the grants as long as the funds are available, and we ask that you write a roundup of your event for the website. If you're interested, fill out the [application form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdlyznxX-zXgjd4MCYfH1YaX0It31Bluwic6tHGwj7n3w7j6A/viewform?usp=sf_link) below or [email us with questions](mailto:samantha@hackshackers.com).

Click [here](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdlyznxX-zXgjd4MCYfH1YaX0It31Bluwic6tHGwj7n3w7j6A/viewform) to open the application in a new window.
